	abstract = {Nucleotide sequences of Rubisco Large Subunit (rbcL) and the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nrDNA were obtained for the five species of Larrea and one species each of Bulnesia (ITS only) and Plectrocarpa (rbcL only). Parsimony analyses were conducted, including sequences from seven genera of Zygophyllaceae reported by other authors-Kallstroemia, Zygophyllum, Augea, Fagonia, Pintoa, Guaiacum, and Porlieria. The main conclusions of the present study are (1) the Argentine endemic Plectrocarpa tetracantha belongs to the subfamily Larreoideae (New World Clade); (2) all three phylogenies obtained from rbcL, ITS, and combined data sets show a close relationship between the tetraploid L. cuneifolia (sect. Bifolium) and the diploid multifoliolate pair L. nitida-L. ameghinoi (sect. Larrea), which could result from a possible intersectional hybrid origin of the tetraploid; (3) L. divaricata (sect. Bifolium) and L. tridentata (sect. Bifolium) form a highly supported monophyletic group, which agrees with previous cytogenetic and molecular evidence; and (4) the rate of nucleotide substitution of rbcL was estimated based on geological and fossil records. Under the molecular clock hypothesis, nucleotide sequence divergence between L. divaricata and L. tridentata suggests a Late Neogene (8.4 to 4.2 mybp) time of arrival of the diploid ancestors of L. tridentata to North American deserts.},

	abstract = {The dry biomes of southern Africa (Desert, Nama Karoo and Succulent Karoo) are home to a rich and diverse xerophytic flora. This flora includes two morphologically diverse clades of Zygophyllaceae, Tetraena and Roepera (Zygophylloideae), which inhabit some of the most arid habitats in the region. Using a plastid phylogeny of Zygophylloideae we assess whether the evolution of putatively adaptive traits (leaf shape, vasculature, mode of water storage and photosynthetic type: C3 versus C4) coincides with the successful colonisation of environments with different drought regimes within southern Africa. Our results show general niche conservatism within arid habitats in Tetraena, but niche shifts from arid to more mesic biomes with longer and/or cooler growing season (Fynbos and Thicket) in Roepera. However, these distinct broad-scale biogeographical patterns are not reflected in leaf anatomy, which seems to vary at more local scales. We observed considerable variability and multiple convergences to similar leaf anatomies in both genera, including shifts between "all cell succulence" leaf types and leaf types with distinct chlorenchyma and hydrenchyma. Our survey of C4 photosynthesis in the Zygophylloideae showed that the C4 pathway is restricted to Tetraena simplex, which also having an annual life history and a widespread distribution, is rather atypical for this group.},

Published sequences of the same gene regions of Australian, Asian and North African Zygophyllum species were included to assess the relationships of the species from these regions to the southern African species. The addition of Z. stapffii from Namibia, found to be conspecific with Z. orbiculatum from Angola, lead to a greatly resolved tree. The molecular results were largely congruent with a recent sectional classification of the southern African species and supported their subdivision into subgenera Agrophyllum and Zygophyllum. Reconstruction of the character evolution of capsule dehiscence, seed attachment and seed mucilage showed that these characters allowed a division of southern African species into the two subgenera but that this could not be applied to species occurring elsewhere. Other morphological characters were found to vary and unique character combinations, rather than unique characters, were found to be of systematic value in sectional delimitation. The study suggests that repeated radiations from the horn of Africa to southern Africa and Asia and back lead to the present distribution of the taxa in the subfamily Zygophylloideae. Although this study supports some of the recent taxonomic changes in the group, the unresolved relationships between the proposed genera Tetraena and Roepera and those retained as Zygophyllum species suggest that changes to the taxonomy may have been premature.},

Fagonia scoparia, from Mexico, and F. cretica, from Northern Africa, are well supported as sisters to all other Fagonia species.

Character-state reconstruction of chromosome number and geographic distribution for our molecular phylogenetic tree showed that 2 n=12 is a plesiomorphic character for Zostera and Heterozostera, that the chromosome number was doubled or tripled in two lineages, and that the initial speciation of Zostera and Heterozostera occurred in the Northern Hemisphere. The matK tree showed the close affinity of Z. noltii and Z. japonica, which have disjunct distributions.

	abstract = {Discerning relationships among species evolved by reticulate and/or polyploid evolution is not an easy task, although it is widely discussed. The economically important genus Curcuma (ca. 120 spp.; Zingiberaceae), broadly distributed in tropical SE Asia, is a particularly interesting example of a group of palaeopolyploid origin whose evolution is driven mainly by hybridization and polyploidization. Although a phylogeny and a new infrageneric classification of Curcuma, based on commonly used molecular markers (ITS and cpDNA), have recently been proposed, significant evolutionary questions remain unresolved. We applied a multilocus approach and a combination of modern analytical methods to this genus to distinguish causes of gene tree incongruence and to identify hybrids and their parental species. Five independent regions of nuclear DNA (DCS, GAPDH, GLOBOSA3, LEAFY, ITS) and four non-coding cpDNA regions (trnL-trnF, trnT-trnL, psbA-trnH and matK), analysed as a single locus, were employed to construct a species tree and hybrid species trees using (*)BEAST and STEM-hy. Detection of hybridogenous species in the dataset was also conducted using the posterior predictive checking approach as implemented in JML. The resulting species tree outlines the relationships among major evolutionary lineages within Curcuma, which were previously unresolved or which conflicted depending upon whether they were based on ITS or cpDNA markers. Moreover, by using the additional markers in tests of plausible topologies of hybrid species trees for C. vamana, C. candida, C. roscoeana and C. myanmarensis suggested by previous molecular and morphological evidence, we found strong evidence that all the species except C. candida are of subgeneric hybrid origin.},

Traditional infrageneric classification in Globba has focused on the number of anther appendages: zero, two, or four. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses were conducted on nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid trnK-matK data from a broad sampling of Globba and related genera. Results show Mantisia to be monophyletic but nested within Globba, while Hemiorchis and Gagnepainia are monophyletic genera that are sister to each other. Anther appendage number and shape, along with inflorescence and fruit morphology, are the most important characters for understanding evolutionary relationships in Globba. A new infrageneric classification system for Globba, recognizing three subgenera and seven sections is presented. The four species of Mantisia are formally transferred into Globba but retained as a distinct section.

Low sequence divergence found in the two genome regions (ITS: 0-2.4\%; trnL-F: 0-1.9\%) suggests recent diversification within the genus. Molecular divergence age estimates give further support to the recent origin of the genus and show that Renealmia has attained its amphi-Atlantic distribution by an oceanic long-distance dispersal event from Africa to South America during the Miocene or Pliocene (15.8-2.7 My ago).

Seventy-two species of Alpinia, 27 non-Alpinia species in the subfamily Alpinioideae, eight species in the subfamily Zingiberoideae, one species in the subfamily Tamijioideae, and three species in the outgroup genus Siphonochilus (Siphonochiloideae) were sequenced for the plastid matK region and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) loci.

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Recent phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data suggested that the monocot family Zingiberaceae be separated into four subfamilies and four tribes. Robust morphological characters to support these clades are lacking. Seeds were analyzed in a phylogenetic context to test independently the circumscription of clades and to better understand evolution of seed characters within Zingiberaceae. METHODS Seventy-five species from three of the four subfamilies were analyzed using synchrotron based x-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) and scored for 39 morphoanatomical characters. KEY RESULTS Zingiberaceae seeds are some of the most structurally complex seeds in angiosperms. No single seed character was found to distinguish each subfamily, but combinations of characters were found to differentiate between the subfamilies. Recognition of the tribes based on seeds was possible for Globbeae, but not for Alpinieae, Riedelieae, or Zingibereae, due to considerable variation. CONCLUSIONS SRXTM is an excellent, nondestructive tool to capture morphoanatomical variation of seeds and allows for the study of taxa with limited material available. Alpinioideae, Siphonochiloideae, Tamijioideae, and Zingiberoideae are well supported based on both molecular and morphological data, including multiple seed characters. Globbeae are well supported as a distinctive tribe within the Zingiberoideae, but no other tribe could be differentiated using seeds due to considerable homoplasy when compared with currently accepted relationships based on molecular data. Novel seed characters suggest tribal affinities for two currently unplaced Zingiberaceae taxa: Siliquamomum may be related to Riedelieae and Monolophus to Zingibereae, but further work is needed before formal revision of the family.},

The bulk of its species were placed in Woodsia, while Cheilanthopsis, Hymenocystis, Physematium, and Protowoodsia are segregates recognized by some authors. Phylogenetic relationships among the genera of Woodsiaceae remain unclear because of the extreme morphological diversity and inadequate taxon sampling in phylogenetic studies to date. In this study, we carry out comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of Woodsiaceae using molecular evidence from four chloroplast DNA markers (atpA, matK, rbcL and trnL-F) and covering over half the currently recognized species. Our results show three main clades in Woodsiaceae corresponding to Physematium (clade I), Cheilanthopsis-Protowoodsia (clade II) and Woodsia s.s. (clade III). In the interest of preserving monophyly and taxonomic stability, a broadly defined Woodsia including the other segregates is proposed, which is characterized by the distinctive indument and inferior indusia. Therefore, we present a new subgeneric classification of the redefined Woodsia based on phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstructions to better reflect the morphological variation, geographic distribution pattern, and evolutionary history of the genus. Our analyses of the cytological character evolution support multiple aneuploidy events that have resulted in the reduction of chromosome base number from 41 to 33, 37, 38, 39 and 40 during the evolutionary history of the cliff ferns.},

Divergence time estimates suggest that the splitting between Drimys and its sister clade (Pseudowintera+Zygogynum s.l.) occurred around the end of the Cretaceous; in contrast, the divergence between the two subclades within Drimys is more recent (15.5-18.5MY) and coincides in time with the Andean uplift.

	abstract = {Vitales is well-known for including the economically important fruit crop, the wine grape (Vitis vinifera). However, the position of the Vitales in the higher eudicots has been a subject of much debate. It has been variously reported to be sister to the Saxifragales and together as sister to the rest of rosids, or sister to the fabids-malvids clade, or sister to the Santalales, or sister to the fabids-malvids-Saxifragales clade. However, in all of these scenarios, the support values for the relationship of Vitales on the phylogenies were only low to moderate. Additionally, all previous studies sampled only Vitis vinifera as the representative of the Vitales. We herein expanded the sampling of the Vitales to include representatives of all major clades of the order, as well as representatives of other key lineages including Saxifragales, Dilleniales, and Santalales. Extensive likelihood and Bayesian analyses were conducted to test the position of Vitales, using different numbers of genes, a variety of partitioning strategies, and both nucleotide and amino acid sequences. With the expanded sampling strategy, almost all analyses supported the relationship of Vitales as sister to Saxifragales. This relationship was supported in a 72-gene data set with a bootstrap value of 91\%, the highest support value reported to date. Based on this topology, we discuss possible morphological synapomorphies shared between Vitales and Saxifragales. Furthermore, a hypothesis of reticulate evolution was postulated as an explanation for the incongruence of Vitales' position when comparing plastid and nuclear gene phylogenies.},

	abstract = {Wild grapes are woody climbers, found mostly in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, comprising the genus Vitis. Despite its importance, the evolutionary history of Vitis is still contentious. Past studies have led to conflicting hypotheses about the phylogeny, speciation events, and biogeographic history of the genus. Here we investigate the evolutionary history of Vitis using data from four chloroplast spacers (trnH-psbA, trnK-rps16, trnF-nahJ, and rpl32-trnL) and the nuclear gene RPB2-I, and we explore mechanisms that could have shaped the observed distribution of current species. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses provided similar results, strongly supporting the presence of two subgenera and suggesting a species clustering within subgenus Vitis that mainly mirrors the disjunction between the Old and New World. Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris was found to be sister to the Asian species while three major clades were found in the American species. A network approach confirmed the main geographic groups and highlighted different chloroplast haplotype patterns between Asian and American species. Molecular dating analysis provided the time boundaries to discuss our results. Our study shows wild grape diversification to be a continuous and complex process that concerned the Tertiary as well as the Quaternary, most likely involving both geographical and climatic forces. Local variations in extent and timing of these forces were discussed based on observed differences between groups. In the context of the Tertiary-Quaternary debate, we provide evidence in favor of the "continuous hypothesis" to explain present diversity. Finally, two directions for future research are highlighted: (i) was the earliest grape American or Asian? and (ii) are all modern grape species real?},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Grapes are one of the most economically important fruit crops. There are about 60 species in the genus Vitis. The phylogenetic relationships among these species are of keen interest for the conservation and use of this germplasm. We selected 309 accessions from 48 Vitis species,varieties, and outgroups, examined {\textasciitilde}11 kb ({\textasciitilde}3.4 Mb total) of aligned nuclear DNA sequences from 27 unlinked genes in a phylogenetic context, and estimated divergence times based on fossil calibrations. RESULTS Vitis formed a strongly supported clade. There was substantial support for species and less for the higher-level groupings (series). As estimated from extant taxa, the crown age of Vitis was 28 Ma and the divergence of subgenera (Vitis and Muscadinia) occurred at {\textasciitilde}18 Ma. Higher clades in subgenus Vitis diverged 16 - 5 Ma with overlapping confidence intervals, and ongoing divergence formed extant species at 12 - 1.3 Ma. Several species had species-specific SNPs. NeighborNet analysis showed extensive reticulation at the core of subgenus Vitis representing the deeper nodes, with extensive reticulation radiating outward. Fitch Parsimony identified North America as the origin of the most recent common ancestor of extant Vitis species. CONCLUSIONS Phylogenetic patterns suggested origination of the genus in North America, fragmentation of an ancestral range during the Miocene, formation of extant species in the late Miocene-Pleistocene, and differentiation of species in the context of Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic and climatic change. Nuclear SNPs effectively resolved relationships at and below the species level in grapes and rectified several misclassifications of accessions in the repositories. Our results challenge current higher-level classifications, reveal the abundance of genetic diversity in the genus that is potentially available for crop improvement, and provide a valuable resource for species delineation, germplasm conservation and use.},

The data for the trnL-F marker were combined with previously published data across the Vitaceae. • KEY RESULTS The molecular phylogeny demonstrated monophyly of the genus Vitis. Based on the combined analysis of three genes, Vitis is split into three clades that mirror the continental distribution of these accessions. The diversity is highest in the Asian clade, but the general genetic distances across taxa from different continents are relatively small. • CONCLUSIONS The findings support a relatively recent and intense gene flow between East Asia and North America and the possible impact of hybridization on the evolution of the genus Vitis.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The Ampelopsis clade (Ampelopsis and its close allies) of the grape family Vitaceae contains ca. 43 species disjunctly distributed in Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Australia, and is a rare example to study both the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere intercontinental disjunctions. We reconstruct the temporal and spatial diversification of the Ampelopsis clade to explore the evolutionary processes that have resulted in their intercontinental disjunctions in six continents. RESULTS The Bayesian molecular clock dating and the likelihood ancestral area analyses suggest that the Ampelopsis clade most likely originated in North America with its crown group dated at 41.2 Ma (95\% HPD 23.4-61.0 Ma) in the middle Eocene. Two independent Laurasian migrations into Eurasia are inferred to have occurred in the early Miocene via the North Atlantic land bridges. The ancestor of the Southern Hemisphere lineage migrated from North America to South America in the early Oligocene. The Gondwanan-like pattern of intercontinental disjunction is best explained by two long-distance dispersals: once from South America to Africa estimated at 30.5 Ma (95\% HPD 16.9-45.9 Ma), and the other from South America to Australia dated to 19.2 Ma (95\% HPD 6.7-22.3 Ma). CONCLUSIONS The global disjunctions in the Ampelopsis clade are best explained by a diversification model of North American origin, two Laurasian migrations, one migration into South America, and two post-Gondwanan long-distance dispersals. These findings highlight the importance of both vicariance and long distance dispersal in shaping intercontinental disjunctions of flowering plants.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY Parthenocissus is a genus of the grape family Vitaceae and has a disjunct distribution in Asia and North America with members in both tropical and temperate regions. The monophyly of Parthenocissus has not yet been tested, and the species relationships and the evolution of its intercontinental disjunction have not been investigated with extensive sampling and molecular phylogenetic methods. • METHODS Plastid (trnL-F, rps16, and atpB-rbcL) and nuclear GAI1 sequences of 56 accessions representing all 12 Parthenocissus species were analyzed with parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian inference. Divergence times of disjunct lineages were estimated with relaxed Bayesian dating. Evolution of the leaflet number was assessed by tracing this character onto Bayesian trees using the Trace Character Over Trees option in the program Mesquite. • KEY RESULTS Parthenocissus is monophyletic and sister to the newly described segregate genus Yua. Two major clades within Parthenocissus are recognizable corresponding to their distribution in Asia and North America. The disjunction between the two continents is estimated to be at 21.64 (95\% higher posterior densities 10.23-34.89) million years ago. • CONCLUSIONS Parthenocissus is likely to have derived from the Eocene boreotropical element. Its current Asian-North American disjunction is dated to the early Miocene, congruent with fossil and paleoclimatic evidence. The tropical species is nested within the temperate clade and is inferred to have dispersed from the adjacent temperate regions. Parthenocissus and Yua are best treated as distinct genera. Leaflet number in this genus has a complex history and cannot be used as a character for infrageneric classification.},

	abstract = {Cayratia consists of ca. 60 species primarily distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and Africa. It is an excellent candidate for exploring the evolution of intercontinental disjunct distributions in the Old World. Previous phylogenetic work of Vitaceae with a few species of Cayratia sampled showed that Cayratia was not monophyletic and was closely related to Cyphostemma and Tetrastigma. We herein expanded taxon sampling of Cayratia (25/60 species) with its allied genera Cyphostemma (39/150 species), Tetrastigma (27/95 species), and other related genera from Vitaceae represented, employing five plastid markers (atpB-rbcL, rps16, trnC-petN, trnH-psbA, and trnL-F), to investigate the phylogeny, character evolution and biogeography of Cayratia. The phylogenetic analyses have confirmed the monophyly of the Cayratia-Cyphostemma-Tetrastigma (CCT) clade and resolved Cayratia into three lineages: the African Cayratia clade, subg. Cayratia, and subg. Discypharia. The African Cayratia was supported as the first diverging lineage within the CCT clade and Tetrastigma is resolved as sister to subg. Discypharia. Character optimizations suggest that the presence/absence of a membrane enclosing the ventral infolds in seeds is an important character for the taxonomy of Cayratia. The presence of bracts on the lower part of the inflorescence axis is inferred to have arisen only once in Cayratia, but this character evolved several times in Tetrastigma. Both the branching pattern of tendrils and the leaf architecture are suggested as important infrageneric characters, but should be used cautiously because some states evolved multiple times. Ancestral area reconstruction and molecular dating suggest that the CCT clade originated from continental Africa in the late Cretaceous, and it then reached Asia twice independently in the late Cretaceous and late Oligocene, respectively. Several dispersals are inferred from Asia to Australia since the Eocene.},

However, well-resolved phylogenies of pantropical clades are still relatively few. Cissus is the largest genus of the grape family Vitaceae and shows a pantropical intercontinental disjunction with its 300 species distributed in all major tropical regions. This study constructed the phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic diversification history of Cissus, employing five plastid markers (rps16, trnL-F, atpB-rbcL, trnH-psbA and trnC-petN). The results confirmed that Cissus polyphyletic, consisting of three main clades: the core Cissus, the Cissus striata complex, and the Australian-Neotropical disjunct Cissus antarctica -C. trianae clade. The latter two clades need to be removed from Cissus to maintain the monophyly of the genus. The core Cissus is inferred to have originated in Africa and is estimated to have diverged from its relatives in Vitaceae in the late Cretaceous. It diversified in Africa into several main lineages in the late Paleocene to the early Eocene, colonized Asia at least three times in the Miocene, and the Neotropics in the middle Eocene. The NALB seems the most plausible route for the core Cissus migration from Africa to the Neotropics in the middle Eocene. Three African-Asian and two Neotropical-Australian disjunctions in Cissus s.l. are estimated to have originated in the Miocene and may be best explained by LDD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The Vitaceae (grape) is an economically important family of angiosperms whose phylogenetic placement is currently unresolved. Recent phylogenetic analyses based on one to several genes have suggested several alternative placements of this family, including sister to Caryophyllales, asterids, Saxifragales, Dilleniaceae or to rest of rosids, though support for these different results has been weak. There has been a recent interest in using complete chloroplast genome sequences for resolving phylogenetic relationships among angiosperms. These studies have clarified relationships among several major lineages but they have also emphasized the importance of taxon sampling and the effects of different phylogenetic methods for obtaining accurate phylogenies. We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of Vitis vinifera and used these data to assess relationships among 27 angiosperms, including nine taxa of rosids. RESULTS The Vitis vinifera chloroplast genome is 160,928 bp in length, including a pair of inverted repeats of 26,358 bp that are separated by small and large single copy regions of 19,065 bp and 89,147 bp, respectively. The gene content and order of Vitis is identical to many other unrearranged angiosperm chloroplast genomes, including tobacco. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood were performed on DNA sequences of 61 protein-coding genes for two datasets with 28 or 29 taxa, including eight or nine taxa from four of the seven currently recognized major clades of rosids. Parsimony and likelihood phylogenies of both data sets provide strong support for the placement of Vitaceae as sister to the remaining rosids. However, the position of the Myrtales and support for the monophyly of the eurosid I clade differs between the two data sets and the two methods of analysis. In parsimony analyses, the inclusion of Gossypium is necessary to obtain trees that support the monophyly of the eurosid I clade. However, maximum likelihood analyses place Cucumis as sister to the Myrtales and therefore do not support the monophyly of the eurosid I clade. CONCLUSION Phylogenies based on DNA sequences from complete chloroplast genome sequences provide strong support for the position of the Vitaceae as the earliest diverging lineage of rosids. Our phylogenetic analyses support recent assertions that inadequate taxon sampling and incorrect model specification for concatenated multi-gene data sets can mislead phylogenetic inferences when using whole chloroplast genomes for phylogeny reconstruction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV and V (Pol IV and V) are multi-subunit enzymes occurring in plants. The origin of Pol V, specific to angiosperms, from Pol IV, which is present in all land plants, is linked to the duplication of the gene encoding the largest subunit and the subsequent subneofunctionalization of the two paralogs (NRPD1 and NRPE1). Additional duplication of the second-largest subunit, NRPD2/NRPE2, has happened independently in at least some eudicot lineages, but its paralogs are often subject to concerted evolution and gene death and little is known about their evolution nor their affinity with Pol IV and Pol V. RESULTS We sequenced a approximately 1500 bp NRPD2/E2-like fragment from 18 Viola species, mostly paleopolyploids, and 6 non-Viola Violaceae species. Incongruence between the NRPD2/E2-like gene phylogeny and species phylogeny indicates a first duplication of NRPD2 relatively basally in Violaceae, with subsequent sorting of paralogs in the descendants, followed by a second duplication in the common ancestor of Viola and Allexis. In Viola, the mutation pattern suggested (sub-) neofunctionalization of the two NRPD2/E2-like paralogs, NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b. The dN/dS ratios indicated that a 54 bp region exerted strong positive selection for both paralogs immediately following duplication. This 54 bp region encodes a domain that is involved in the binding of the Nrpd2 subunit with other Pol IV/V subunits, and may be important for correct recognition of subunits specific to Pol IV and Pol V. Across all Viola taxa 73 NRPD2/E2-like sequences were obtained, of which 23 (32\%) were putative pseudogenes - all occurring in polyploids. The NRPD2 duplication was conserved in all lineages except the diploid MELVIO clade, in which NRPD2/E2-b was lost, and its allopolyploid derivates from hybridization with the CHAM clade, section Viola and section Melanium, in which NRPD2/E2-a occurred in multiple copies while NRPD2/E2-b paralogs were either absent or pseudogenized. CONCLUSIONS Following the relatively recent split of Pol IV and Pol V, our data indicate that these two multi-subunit enzymes are still in the process of specialization and each acquiring fully subfunctionalized copies of their subunit genes. Even after specialization, the NRPD2/E2-like paralogs are prone to pseudogenization and gene conversion and NRPD2 and NRPE2 copy number is a highly dynamic process modulated by allopolyploidy and gene death.},

Especially for high polyploids (i.e., organisms with more than six sets of nuclear chromosomes), the signatures of gene homoeolog loss, deep coalescence, and polyploidy may become confounded, with the result that gene trees may be congruent with more than one species network. Herein, we obtained the most parsimonious species network by objective comparison of competing scenarios involving polyploidization and homoeolog loss in a high-polyploid lineage of violets (Viola, Violaceae) mostly or entirely restricted to North America, Central America, or Hawaii. We amplified homoeologs of the low-copy nuclear gene, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), by single-molecule polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the chloroplast trnL-F region by conventional PCR for 51 species and subspecies. Topological incongruence among GPI homoeolog subclades, owing to deep coalescence and two instances of putative loss (or lack of detection) of homoeologs, were reconciled by applying the maximum tree topology for each subclade. The most parsimonious species network and the fossil-based calibration of the homoeolog tree favored monophyly of the high polyploids, which has resulted from allodecaploidization 9-14 Ma, involving sympatric ancestors from the extant Viola sections Chamaemelanium (diploid), Plagiostigma (paleotetraploid), and Viola (paleotetraploid). Although two of the high-polyploid lineages (Boreali-Americanae, Pedatae) remained decaploid, recurrent polyploidization with tetraploids of section Plagiostigma within the last 5 Ma has resulted in two 14-ploid lineages (Mexicanae, Nosphinium) and one 18-ploid lineage (Langsdorffianae). This implies a more complex phylogenetic and biogeographic origin of the Hawaiian violets (Nosphinium) than that previously inferred from rDNA data and illustrates the necessity of considering polyploidy in phylogenetic and biogeographic reconstruction.},

We used a four-step approach to generate a dated polyploid species network for the cosmopolitan angiosperm genus Viola L. (Violaceae Batch.). The genus contains ca 600 species and both recent (neo-) and more ancient (meso-) polyploid lineages distributed over 16 sections. First, we obtained DNA sequences of three low-copy nuclear genes and one chloroplast region, from 42 species representing all 16 sections. Second, we obtained fossil-calibrated chronograms for each nuclear gene marker. Third, we determined the most parsimonious multilabeled genome tree and its corresponding network, resolved at the section (not the species) level. Reconstructing the "correct" network for a set of polyploids depends on recovering all homoeologs, i.e., all subgenomes, in these polyploids. Assuming the presence of Viola subgenome lineages that were not detected by the nuclear gene phylogenies ("ghost subgenome lineages") significantly reduced the number of inferred polyploidization events. We identified the most parsimonious network topology from a set of five competing scenarios differing in the interpretation of homoeolog extinctions and lineage sorting, based on (i) fewest possible ghost subgenome lineages, (ii) fewest possible polyploidization events, and (iii) least possible deviation from expected ploidy as inferred from available chromosome counts of the involved polyploid taxa. Finally, we estimated the homoploid and polyploid speciation times of the most parsimonious network. Homoploid speciation times were estimated by coalescent analysis of gene tree node ages. Polyploid speciation times were estimated by comparing branch lengths and speciation rates of lineages with and without ploidy shifts. Our analyses recognize Viola as an old genus (crown age 31 Ma) whose evolutionary history has been profoundly affected by allopolyploidy. Between 16 and 21 allopolyploidizations are necessary to explain the diversification of the 16 major lineages (sections) of Viola, suggesting that allopolyploidy has accounted for a high percentage-between 67\% and 88\%-of the speciation events at this level. The theoretical and methodological approaches presented here for (i) constructing networks and (ii) dating speciation events within a network, have general applicability for phylogenetic studies of groups where allopolyploidization has occurred. They make explicit use of a hitherto underexplored source of ploidy information from chromosome counts to help resolve phylogenetic cases where incomplete sequence data hampers network inference. Importantly, the coalescent-based method used herein circumvents the assumption of tree-like evolution required by most techniques for dating speciation events.},

The Hawaiian violets are a monophyletic lineage of nine taxa distributed across six main islands of the Hawaiian archipelago. To describe the evolutionary relationships, biogeography, and molecular evolution rates of the Hawaiian violets, we conducted a phylogenetic study using nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer sequences from specimens of each species. Parsimony, maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian inference reconstructions of island colonization and radiation strongly suggest that the Hawaiian violets first colonized the Maui Nui Complex, quickly radiated to Kaua'i and O'ahu, and recently dispersed to Hawai'i. The lineage consists of "wet" and "dry" clades restricted to distinct precipitation regimes. The ML and Bayesian inference reconstructions of shifts in habitat, habit, and leaf shape indicate that ecologically analogous taxa have undergone parallel evolution in leaf morphology and habit. This parallel evolution correlates with shifts to specialized habitats. Relative rate tests showed that woody and herbaceous sister species possess equal molecular evolution rates. The incongruity of molecular evolution rates in taxa on younger islands suggests that these rates may not be determined by growth form (or lifespan) alone, but may be influenced by complex dispersal events.},

Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches identified shifts in diversification rate and possible links to character evolution. We inferred the ancestral environment for Viburnum and changes in diversification dynamics associated with subsequent biome shifts. Viburnum probably diversified in tropical forests of Southeast Asia in the Eocene, with three subsequent radiations in temperate clades during the Miocene. Four traits (purple fruits, extrafloral nectaries, bud scales and toothed leaves) were statistically associated with higher rates of diversification. However, we argue that these traits are unlikely to be driving diversification directly. Instead, two radiations were associated with the occupation of mountainous regions and a third with repeated shifts between colder and warmer temperate forests. Early-branching depauperate lineages imply that the rare lowland tropical species are 'dying embers' of once more diverse lineages; net diversification rates in Viburnum likely decreased in these tropical environments after the Oligocene. We suggest that 'taxon pulse' dynamics might characterize other temperate plant lineages.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-12-73},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND The chloroplast genes matK and rbcL have been proposed as a "core" DNA barcode for identifying plant species. Published estimates of successful species identification using these loci (70-80\%) may be inflated because they may have involved comparisons among distantly related species within target genera. To assess the ability of the proposed two-locus barcode to discriminate closely related species, we carried out a hierarchically structured set of comparisons within Viburnum, a clade of woody angiosperms containing ca. 170 species (some 70 of which are currently used in horticulture). For 112 Viburnum species, we evaluated rbcL + matK, as well as the chloroplast regions rpl32-trnL, trnH-psbA, trnK, and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (nrITS). RESULTS At most, rbcL + matK could discriminate 53\% of all Viburnum species, with only 18\% of the comparisons having genetic distances {\textgreater}1\%. When comparisons were progressively restricted to species within major Viburnum subclades, there was a significant decrease in both the discriminatory power and the genetic distances. trnH-psbA and nrITS show much higher levels of variation and potential discriminatory power, and their use in plant barcoding should be reconsidered. As barcoding has often been used to discriminate species within local areas, we also compared Viburnum species within two regions, Japan and Mexico and Central America. Greater success in discriminating among the Japanese species reflects the deeper evolutionary history of Viburnum in that area, as compared to the recent radiation of a single clade into the mountains of Latin America. CONCLUSIONS We found very low levels of discrimination among closely related species of Viburnum, and low levels of variation in the proposed barcoding loci may limit success within other clades of long-lived woody plants. Inclusion of the supplementary barcodes trnH-psbA and nrITS increased discrimination rates but were often more effective alone rather than in combination with rbcL + matK. We surmise that the efficacy of barcoding in plants has often been overestimated because of the lack of comparisons among closely related species. Phylogenetic information must be incorporated to properly evaluate relatedness in assessing the utility of barcoding loci.},

We hoped to resolve these issues by sequencing whole plastid genomes for representative species and combining these with molecular data previously obtained from an expanded taxon sample.• Methods: We performed paired-end Illumina sequencing of plastid genomes of 22 Viburnum species and combined these data with a 10-gene data set to infer phylogenetic relationships for 113 species. We used the results to devise a comprehensive phylogenetic classification and to analyze the evolution of eight morphological characters that vary among early-branching lineages.• Key results: With greatly increased levels of confidence in most of the early branches, we propose a phylogenetic classification of Viburnum, providing formal phylogenetic definitions for 30 clades, including 13 with names recognized under the International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants, eight with previously proposed informal names, and nine newly proposed names for major branches. Our parsimony reconstructions of bud structure, leaf margins, inflorescence form, ruminate endosperm, extrafloral nectaries, glandular trichomes, palisade anatomy, and pollen exine showed varying levels of homoplasy, but collectively provided morphological support for some, though not all, of the major clades.• Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the value of next-generation plastid sequencing, the ease of creating a formal phylogenetic classification, and the utility of such a system in describing patterns of character evolution.},

Lack of appropriate molecular markers that give sufficient resolution to gene trees is one of the major impediments to inferring species level phylogenies. In addition, sampling multiple independent loci is essential to overcome the lineage sorting problem. The availability of nuclear loci has often been a limiting factor in plant species-level phylogenetic studies. Here the two PHOT loci were developed as new sources of nuclear gene trees. The PHOT1 and PHOT2 gene trees of the Verbena complex (Verbenaceae) are well resolved and have good clade support. These gene trees are consistent with each other and previously generated chloroplast and nuclear waxy gene trees in most of the phylogenetic backbone as well as some terminal relationships, but are incongruent in some other relationships. Locus-specific primers were optimized for amplifying and sequencing these two loci in all Lamiales. Comparing intron size in the context of the gene trees shows dramatic variation within the Verbena complex, particularly at the PHOT1 locus. These variations are largely caused by invasions of short transposable elements and frequent long deletions and insertions of unknown causes. In addition, inspection of DNA sequences and phylogenetic analyses unmask a clear footprint of ancestral recombination in one species.},

	abstract = {Two major impediments to infer plant phylogenies at inter- or intra- species level include the lack of appropriate molecular markers and the gene tree/species tree discordance. Both of these problems require more extensive investigations. One of the foci of this study is examining the phylogenetic utility of a combined chloroplast DNA dataset ({\textgreater}5.0kb) of seven non-coding regions, in comparison with that of a large fragment (ca. 3.0kb) of a low-copy nuclear gene (waxy), in a recent, rapidly diversifying group, the Verbena complex. The complex includes three very closely related genera, Verbena (base chromosome number x=7), Glandularia (x=5), and Junellia (x=10), comprising some 150 species distributed predominantly in South and North America. Our results confirm the inadequacy of non-coding cpDNA in resolving relationships among closely related species due to lack of variation, and the great potential of low-copy nuclear gene as source of variation. However, this study suggests that when both cpDNA and nuclear DNA are employed in low-level phylogenetic studies, cpDNA might be very useful to infer organelle evolutionary history (e.g., chloroplast transfer) and more comprehensively understand the evolutionary history of organisms. The phylogenetic framework of the Verbena complex resulted from this study suggests that Junellia is paraphyletic and most ancestral among the three genera; both Glandularia and Verbena are monophyletic and have been derived from within Junellia. Implications of this phylogenetic framework to understand chromosome number evolution and biogeography are discussed. Most interestingly, the comparison of the cpDNA and nuclear DNA phylogenies indicates two independent intergeneric chloroplast transfers, both from Verbena to Glandularia. One is from a diploid North American Verbena species to a polyploid North American Glandularia species. The other is more ancient, from the South American Verbena group to the common ancestor of a major Glandularia lineage, which has radiated subsequently in both South and North America. The commonly assumed introgressive hybridization may not explain the chloroplast transfers reported here. The underlying mechanism remains uncertain.},

Two genera, Dipyrena and Rhaphithamnus, remain unplaced. The aim of this work is to reconstruct the evolutionary history of morphological characters traditionally employed in the classification of the Verbenaceae, with special attention to tribes Verbeneae and Lantaneae. METHODS Twenty-one characters, related to habit and vegetative morphology, inflorescence and floral morphology, ovary and fruit morphology, as well as chromosome number, were optimized over a molecular phylogeny of Verbenaceae. KEY RESULTS All tribes are supported by at least one morphological trait except tribes Duranteae and Citharexyleae. Suffrutescent habit, sessile flowers, and four cluses are synapomorphies for tribe Verbeneae. Gynoecium with short style and entire stigma are synapomorphic traits for tribe Lantaneae. Sessile flowers and unicarpellate ovaries are morphological synapomorphies for the new tribe Neospartoneae. Suffrutescent habit is a synapomorphic trait for tribe Priveae. Homothetic pleiobotrya and absence of the adaxial staminode are synapomorphic traits for tribe Casselieae. Undivided fleshy fruits are probably a synapomorphic trait for tribe Petreeae. Putative plesiomorphies for the ancestor of the Verbenaceae are discussed as well as synapomorphic traits within other Verbenaceae clades. CONCLUSIONS Many of the characters traditionally employed in classification have proven to be very homoplastic, or have been shown not to support relationships within the family. Moreover, traditional assumptions concerning character polarity have in some cases been shown to be incorrect.},

A second center of diversity exists in Africa. Competing morphology-based classifications that rely on different traits conflict in significant ways. A broad phylogenetic study was undertaken to assess those classifications and to examine the historical geography of the family. • METHODS Analysis of seven chloroplast DNA regions for 109 species, representing all genera except one monotypic genus, provide inference into evolutionary relationships in Verbenaceae. • KEY RESULTS The phylogeny shows that none of the traditional classifications reflect phylogenetic relationships very well. Eight clades are recognized as tribes (Casselieae, Citharexyleae, Duranteae, Lantaneae, Neospartoneae trib. nov., Petreeae, Priveae, and Verbeneae). Two genera, Dipyrena and Rhaphithamnus, remain unplaced in these larger clades. Petreeae, which consist of Neotropical lianas, are sister to the rest of the family. Lantaneae and Verbeneae together form a derived clade that comprises approximately two-thirds of the species in Verbenaceae. • CONCLUSIONS We present a new tribal classification, including one new tribe, Neospartoneae trib. nov., to accommodate three small genera of Argentine species (Diostea, Neosparton, and Lampaya).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The monophyly of Valerianaceae and the precise delimitation of the family are not totally resolved. Our knowledge on the phylogeny of the group is only partial: on a morphological basis, some contradicting taxonomic proposals have been published, which demonstrates the difficulties in establishing a natural classification of the family and especially in proposing a relevant treatment of the large genus Valeriana. The aims of this study are to contribute to the phylogeny and generic delineation of the Valerianaceae on the basis of molecular data. METHODS A cladistic analysis of the sequences of one plastid (matK) and one nuclear (ITS) molecular marker was carried out, both individually and in combination. KEY RESULTS The results of the analyses of both regions confirm that the family is monophyletic, with the exclusion of Triplostegia. The tribe Patrinieae is monophyletic, and the tribe Valerianeae is also a natural group. Two of the subtribes of Valerianeae, Fediinae and Centranthinae, are also monophyletic, with the exclusion of the genus Plectritis from Fediinae. The subtribe Valerianinae, on the other hand, is paraphyletic. CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm, for the first time on a molecular basis, the suggested paraphyly of Valeriana in its present circumscription, with profound nomenclatural and taxonomic implications. The correlation between molecular phylogeny and biogeography is close. In the course of the plastid DNA sequencing, a polymorphism concerning the matK gene was found, a fact that should be carefully evaluated in phylogenetic analyses.},

	abstract = {The southern Andean clade of Valeriana provides an excellent model for the study of biogeography. Here we provide new data to help clarify phylogenetic relationships among the South American valerians, with special focus on taxa found in the southern Andes. We found that the southern Andean taxa formed a clade in maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses, and used a Bayesian relaxed clock method to estimate divergence times within Valerianaceae. Our temporal results were similar to other studies, but we found greater variance in our estimates, suggesting that the species of Valeriana have been on the South American continent for some time, and have been successful at exploiting new niche opportunities that reflects the contemporary radiation. Regardless of the time frame for the radiation of the clade, the uptick in the rate of diversification in Valerianaceae appears correlated with a dispersal event from Central to South America. The appearance of Valeriana in the southern Andes (13.7 Ma) corresponds with the transition from closed forest on the western side of the Andes in central Chile to a more open Mediterranean woodland environment. This would suggest that the high species richness of Valerianaceae in South America is the result of multiple, smaller radiations such as the one in the southern Andes, that may or may not be geographically isolated. These smaller radiations may also be driven by species moving into new biomes (migration from a temperate to a more Mediterranean-type climate and into alpine). The degree to which different ecological and geological factors interact to drive diversification is difficult to ascertain. Likewise, without a better-resolved phylogeny it is impossible to determine the directionality of dispersal in this group; did they colonize the southern Andes first, then move northward as the central Andean alpine habitat became more widely available or vice versa?},

While the phylogeny of Valerianaceae has received a great deal of attention in the last decade, species relationships have been hard to resolve using traditional phylogenetic markers. Here, we collected high-throughput genomic sequence data from reduced-representation libraries obtained through GBS protocols. Putative orthologs were identified using within- and among-sample clustering using the computer software pyRAD. We recovered over 3000 loci for 14 species of southern South AmericanValeriana,with 140 loci present across all samples.We analyzed a set of phylogenetic trees generated from each locus using maximum likelihood methods, as well as multispecies coalescent (∗BEAST) methods.

One group that has never been included in any analyses to date is the North American representatives of Valerianella. In this study I sampled 17 additional accessions from Valerianaceae, including six of the 12 described North American Valerianella species and four additional samples of European Valerianella species. Phylogenies based on parsimony and Bayesian methods show strong support for placing the North American Valerianella nested within the European species. These analyses also found Fedia to be nested within Valerianella, making Valerianella paraphyletic, a result consistent with several previously published molecular phylogenies. Divergence times estimated from the molecular data using recently proposed Bayesian 'relaxed' clock methods, suggest Valerianella was in North America by the middle Miocene (ca. 16-14 million years ago). These dates would suggest the North American species of Valerianella arrived in the New World just prior to the North Atlantic land bridge (NALB) no longer being a viable conduit for migration. Given the large amount of uncertainty in the divergence time estimates, dispersal across the North Atlantic may not be the only viable alternative to explain the current distribution of Valerianella. However, biogeographic analyses using an explicit model based approach, strongly favor the NALB as the route of dispersal for Valerianella.},

	abstract = {Valerianaceae is a relatively small (ca. 350 species), but morphologically diverse angiosperm clade. Sequence data from the entire ndhF gene, the trnL-F intergenic spacer region, the trnL intron, the matK region, the rbcL-atpB intergenic spacer region and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA were collected for 21 taxa within Dipsacaceae and Valerianaceae (1 and 20, respectively). These data were included in several phylogenetic analyses with previously published sequences from Dipsacales. Results from these analyses (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analysis) are in strong agreement with many of the conclusions from previous studies, most importantly: (1) Valerianaceae is sister to Dipsacaceae; (2) Triplostegia is more closely related to species of Dipsacaceae than to Valerianaceae; and (3) Valeriana appears not to be monophyletic, with Valeriana celtica falling outside the remainder of the species of Valeriana sampled here (with very strong support). With the exception of V. celtica, these data support two major clades within Valeriana; one that is exclusively New World and another that is distributed in both the Old and New World. Although the species of Valerianaceae and its sister group Dipsacaceae plus Triplostegia, are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, and the data imply that Valerianaceae diversified initially in Asia (the Himalayan Patrinia and Nardostachys falling at the base of the clade), the center of modern species diversity for the group is in the Andes of South America with as many as 175 species restricted to that region. Although the exclusively South American taxa form a clade in the chloroplast and combined ITS and chloroplast analyses, support values tend to be low. Future studies will need to include additional data, in the form of both characters and taxa, before any strong conclusions about the character evolution, diversification, and biogeography of the South American valerians can be made.},

A new, multigene phylogeny with representatives of all five genera of Cecropieae (most of them from the Neotropics) and half of the 61 species of Cecropia shows the West African endemic Musanga (2spp.) as sister to Cecropia, implying dispersal from the Neotropics to Africa, with a molecular clock suggesting that this occurred about 23Mya. Cecropia, a genus of neotropical pioneer trees, started diversifying ca. 8Mya. We infer a single origin of specialized symbiosis with Azteca within Cecropia, eight complete losses of this symbiosis, and a potential partner shift involving the replacement of Azteca by Neoponera luteola ants. Niche space modeling based on geo-referenced occurrences of over 9000 collections representing 58 of the 61 species of Cecropia, together with several comparative analyses, implies that mutualism loss is concentrated at high altitudes and on Caribbean islands, with the surprisingly frequent breakdowns potentially facilitated by low species-specificity of interacting Cecropia and Azteca mutualists.},

However, throughout its geographical range morphologically nearly indistinguishable species are found alongside morphologically quite disparate species, with the overall diversity of morphological characters extremely limited. The systematics of Urtica have puzzled scientists for the past 200years and no single comprehensive attempt at understanding infrageneric relationships has been published in the past, nor are species delimitations unequivocally established. We here provide the first comprehensive phylogeny of the genus including 61 of the 63 species recognized, represented by 144 ingroup accessions and 14 outgroup taxa. The markers ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, psbA-trnH intergenic spacer, trnL-trnF and trnS-trnG are used. The phylogeny is well resolved. The eastern Asian Zhengyia shennongensis T. Deng, D.G. Zhang \& H. Sun is retrieved as sister to Urtica. Within Urtica, a clade comprising the western Eurasian species U. pilulifera L. and U. neubaueri Chrtek is sister to all other species of the genus. The phylogenetic analyses retrieve numerous well-supported clades, suggesting previously unsuspected relationships and implying that classically used taxonomic characters such as leaf morphology and growth habit are highly homoplasious. Species delimitation is problematical, and several accessions assigned to Urtica dioica L. (as subspecies) are retrieved in widely different places in the phylogeny. The genus seems to have undergone numerous dispersal-establishment events both between continents and onto different islands. Three recent species radiations are inferred, one in America centered in the Andes, one in New Zealand, and one in northern Eurasia which includes Urtica dioica s.str. sensu Henning et al. (2014). The present study provides the basis of a critical re-examination of species limits and taxonomy, but also of the dispersal ecology of this widespread plant group and an in-depth study of the three clades with recent radiations.},

Sparganium presents an opportunity to investigate diversification, character evolution, and biogeographical relationships in a widespread temperate genus of aquatic monocots. We present a fossil-calibrated, molecular phylogeny of Sparganium based on analysis of two chloroplast and two nuclear markers. Within this framework, we examine character evolution in both habit and stigma number and infer the ancestral area and biogeographic history of the genus. • METHODS Sequence data from two cpDNA and two nDNA markers were analyzed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. We used the program BEAST to simultaneously estimate phylogeny and divergence times, S-DIVA and Lagrange for biogeographical reconstruction, and BayesTraits to examine locule number and habit evolution. • KEY RESULTS Two major clades were recovered with strong support: one composed of S. erectum and S. eurycarpum; and the other containing all remaining Sparganium. We realigned the subgenera to conform to these clades. Divergence time analysis suggests a Miocene crown origin but Pliocene diversification. Importantly, the floating-leaved habit has arisen multiple times in the genus, from emergent ancestors-contrary to past hypotheses. • CONCLUSIONS Cooling trends during the Tertiary are correlated with the isolation of temperate Eurasian and North American taxa. Vicariance, long-distance dispersal, and habitat specialization are proposed as mechanisms for Sparganium diversification.},

	abstract = {Turnera provides a useful system for exploring two significant evolutionary phenomena-shifts in breeding system (distyly vs. homostyly) and the evolution of polyploids. To explore these, the first molecular phylogeny of Turnera was constructed using sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA for 37 taxa. We attempted to resolve the origins of allopolyploid species using single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing of homeologous copies of ITS. Two allohexaploid species possessed putative ITS homeologues (T. velutina and T. orientalis). A phylogenetic analysis to identify progenitors contributing to the origins of these polyploids was unsuccessful, possibly as a result of concerted evolution of ITS. Breeding system evolution was mapped onto the phylogeny assuming distyly to be ancestral in Turnera. Self-compatible homostyly appears to have arisen independently at least three times in Turnera; however, we were not able to determine whether there have been independent origins of homostyly among hexaploid species in series Turnera. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that series Turnera is monophyletic. Neither series Microphyllae nor Anomalae, however, appear to be monophyletic. Future taxonomic revisions may require new circumscriptions of these latter series.},

	abstract = {The mycoheterotrophic plant family Triuridaceae (Pandanales) is hypothesized to be an old family, mainly based on its pantropical distribution. The existence of fossils from the Upper Cretaceous, assigned to Triuridaceae may form additional support for a great age of the family, although the affinity of these fossils to Triuridaceae is questioned. Although the circumscription of Triuridaceae has never been problematic, probably due to its distinct morphological characters, its systematic relationship has been under debate since the family was described around 1840. The lack of synapomorphies suitable for resolving higher taxonomic relationships is a function of the family's reduced vegetative growth and the highly modified floral structures. Molecular studies have assigned Triuridaceae to Pandanales, but its exact phylogenetic position remains unknown. In the present study the phylogeny of the Pandanales was reconstructed using four molecular markers and the divergence age estimates were obtained with a relaxed molecular clock method. We found that Triuridaceae are monophyletic and most likely descent form the second major split in Pandanales. The relationships between the other Pandanales families (Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae, Stemonaceae and Velloziaceae) are otherwise in accordance with earlier studies. Velloziaceae are sister to the rest of the Pandanales, Stemonaceae are most likely sister to a clade consisting of Pandanaceae and Cyclanthaceae, and the latter two families are sister to each other. All currently recognized tribes within Triuridaceae are also monophyletic at current taxon sampling. We estimate that the family has a Cretaceous (or Lower Paleocene) stem age, which is in accordance with earlier predictions. This old age, along with elevated mutation rates indicated by long branch lengths and the family's mycoheterotrophic lifestyle, might account for the substantial morphological differences between Triuridaceae and its closest relatives.},

We found that Tofieldia, Triantha, Pleea, and Harperocallis form the same clade, which receives 100\% bootstrap support. This clade can be regarded as corresponding to Tofieldiaceae, and is embedded in the clade of Alismatales (98\%). On the other hand, Isidrogalvia is not included in this Tofieldiaceae clade, and positioned as sister to Narthecium (100\%), embedded in the clade of Nartheciaceae (Dioscoreales) (100\%). In the Tofieldiaceae, Pleea first diverges from the remaining three genera (100\%), and then, Harperocallis diverges from the Tofieldia- Triantha complex (100\%). In the Tofieldia- Triantha complex, five Tofieldia species form the same clade (100\%), and two Triantha species form another clade (100\%). Thus, Isidrogalvia should be transferred from Tofieldiaceae to Nartheciaceae. As Isidrogalvia, as well as the Nartheciaceae, have the carpels that are fully connate into a single style, Isidrogalvia fits the Nartheciaceae well with respect to carpel connation. After this transfer, the Tofieldiaceae correspond mainly to plants with almost free carpels and three styles. Pleea is better treated as an independent genus than included in Tofieldia. Triantha can be treated either as an independent genus or as congeneric with Tofieldia.},

We report here the complete plastid genome sequences of four Tilia species determined by the Illumina technology. The Tilia plastid genome is 162,653 bp to 162,796 bp in length, encoding 113 unique genes and a total number of 130 genes. The gene order and organization of the Tilia plastid genome exhibits the general structure of angiosperms and is very similar to other published plastid genomes of Malvaceae. As other long-lived tree genera, the sequence divergence among the four Tilia plastid genomes is very low. And we analyzed the nucleotide substitution patterns and the evolution of insertions and deletions in the Tilia plastid genomes. Finally, we build a phylogeny of the four sampled Tilia species with high supports using plastid phylogenomics, suggesting that it is an efficient way to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of this genus.},

	abstract = {Historic events such as the uplift of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Q-T Plateau) and climatic oscillations in the Quaternary period greatly affected the evolution and modern distribution of Sino-Tibetan flora. Stellera chamaejasme, a perennial herb with flower color polymorphism that is distributed from the mountainous southeastern Q-T Plateau (Hengduan Mountains, H-D Mountains) to the vast platform of the Q-T Plateau and the adjacent plain of northern China, provides an excellent model to explore the effects of historic events on the origination and variation of species. In this study, we conducted a phylogenetic and phylogeographical study using three chloroplast sequences (trnT-L, trnL-F and rpL16) in 26 populations of S. chamaejasme and 12 outgroups from the Thymeleaceae. Phylogenetic analysis and molecular clock estimation revealed that the monophyletic origin of S. chamaejasme occurred ca. 6.5892 Ma, which is consistent with the radical environment changes caused by the rapid uplift of the Q-T Plateau ca. 7 Ma. Intra-specific differentiation of S. chamaejasme is estimated to have occurred after ca. 2.1 Ma. Twelve haplotypes were revealed from combined trnL-F and rpL16 sequences. High genetic diversity (h(T)=0.834) and population differentiation (N(ST)=0.997 and G(ST)=0.982) imply restricted gene flow among populations and significant geographical or environmental isolation. All populations from the vast plain of northern China were dominated by one haplotype (H1), and the same haplotype was fixed in most populations from the high elevation platform of the western and northern Q-T Plateau. In contrast, the majority of the haplotypes were found in the relatively narrow area of the H-D Mountains, in the southeastern distribution of S. chamaejasme. The contrasting haplotype distribution patterns suggested that the H-D Mountains were either a refugium for S. chamaejasme during the Quaternary climatic oscillations or a diversification center of this species. The present wide distribution of this species on the Q-T Plateau platform and in northern China is likely to have resulted from a rapid post-glacial population expansion from the southeastern refugium involving founder effects, facilitated by the adjacent geographic range with a similar grassland habitat.},

The results from the combined analysis are the most resolved and provide a high level of support for the monophyly of Themidaceae. Within Themidaceae, the Milla complex of Mexico is supported as monophyletic within a paraphyletic Brodiaea complex of western North America. Four major clades are identified in each of the individual and combined analyses: (1) the Milla complex; (2) Brodiaea, Dichelostemma, and Triteleiopsis; (3) Triteleia, Bloomeria, and Muilla clevelandii; and (4) Androstephium and the other species of Muilla. These well-defined clades suggest that morphological characters (e.g., an extended perianth tube) that have been traditionally used to circumscribe the genera within the Brodiaea complex have evolved independently at least twice. In addition, common biogeographic distribution patterns (e.g., Brodiaea and Triteleia having centers of diversity in northern California and the Pacific Northwest) appear to be the result of separate evolutionary radiations.},

	abstract = {Thelypteridaceae is one of the largest families of polypodioid ferns. The generic classification of the family is still controversial because of high levels of convergent or parallel evolution of morphological characters and a lack of molecular phylogenetic studies. In the present study, phylogenetic analyses of three chloroplast regions (rbcL, rps4 and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer region) for 115 taxa, representing 27 recognized segregates in the family, were conducted to explore infrafamilial relationships and gain further understanding of generic boundaries. The phylogenetic reconstructions resolved six distinct clades (Clade I-VI) with strong support. Seven genera: Cyclogramma, Macrothelypteris, Oreopteris, Phegopteris, Pseudophegopteris, Stegnogramma, and Thelypteris are recognized from Clades I, II, IV, and V. In Clade III, Metathelypteris was supported as monophyletic, but the other segregates Amauropelta, Coryphopteris, and Parathelypteris were polyphyletic or paraphyletic, preventing clear recognition of generic boundaries within this clade without additional sampling. Considering great morphological homoplasy within Clade VI, a large genus Cyclosorus is recognized to comprise several small recognized segregates. Within this clade, Pronephrium, and Christella were revealed to be polyphyletic, but several Asian-endemic segregates, such as Glaphyropteridopsis, Mesopteris, and Pseudocyclosorus were strongly supported as monophyletic. Analyses of the evolution of morphological character states on the molecular phylogeny showed extremely high levels of homoplastic evolution for many diagnostic characters.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ympev.2015.09.009},
	abstract = {Thelypteridaceae is one of the largest fern families, having about 950 species and a cosmopolitan distribution but with most species occurring in tropical and subtropical regions. Its generic classification remains controversial, with different authors recognizing from one up to 32 genera. Phylogenetic relationships within the family have not been exhaustively studied, but previous studies have confirmed the monophyly of the lineage. Thus far, sampling has been inadequate for establishing a robust hypothesis of infrafamilial relationships within the family. In order to understand phylogenetic relationships within Thelypteridaceae and thus to improve generic reclassification, we expand the molecular sampling, including new samples of Old World taxa and, especially, many additional neotropical representatives. We also explore the monophyly of exclusively or mostly neotropical genera Amauropelta, Goniopteris, Meniscium, and Steiropteris. Our sampling includes 68 taxa and 134 newly generated sequences from two plastid genomic regions (rps4-trnS and trnL-trnF), plus 73 rps4 and 72 trnL-trnF sequences from GenBank. These data resulted in a concatenated matrix of 1980 molecular characters for 149 taxa. The combined data set was analyzed using maximum parsimony and bayesian inference of phylogeny. Our results are consistent with the general topological structure found in previous studies, including two main lineages within the family: phegopteroid and thelypteroid. The thelypteroid lineage comprises two clades; one of these included the segregates Metathelypteris, Coryphopteris, and Amauropelta (including part of Parathelypteris), whereas the other comprises all segregates of Cyclosorus s.l., such as Goniopteris, Meniscium, and Steiropteris (including Thelypteris polypodioides, previously incertae sedis). The three mainly neotropical segregates were found to be monophyletic but nested in a broadly defined Cyclosorus. The fourth mainly neotropical segregate, Amauropelta, was found to include species considered to be part of Parathelypteris. In Old World thelypteroids, which correspond to nearly half the diversity in the family, an increase in sampling is still needed to resolve relationships and circumscription of genera, particularly in the christelloid clade (i.e., Amphineuron, Chingia, Christella, Pneumatopteris, Pronephrium, and Sphaerostephanos). Based on currently available knowledge, we propose the recognition of 16 genera in the family.},

	abstract = {Schima is an ecologically and economically important woody genus in tea family (Theaceae). Unresolved species delimitations and phylogenetic relationships within Schima limit our understanding of the genus and hinder utilization of the genus for economic purposes. In the present study, we conducted comparative analysis among the complete chloroplast (cp) genomes of 11 Schima species. Our results indicate that Schima cp genomes possess a typical quadripartite structure, with conserved genomic structure and gene order. The size of the Schima cp genome is about 157 kilo base pairs (kb). They consistently encode 114 unique genes, including 80 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNAs, and 4 rRNAs, with 17 duplicated in the inverted repeat (IR). These cp genomes are highly conserved and do not show obvious expansion or contraction of the IR region. The percent variability of the 68 coding and 93 noncoding ({\textgreater}150 bp) fragments is consistently less than 3\%. The seven most widely touted DNA barcode regions as well as one promising barcode candidate showed low sequence divergence. Eight mutational hotspots were identified from the 11 cp genomes. These hotspots may potentially be useful as specific DNA barcodes for species identification of Schima. The 58 cpSSR loci reported here are complementary to the microsatellite markers identified from the nuclear genome, and will be leveraged for further population-level studies. Phylogenetic relationships among the 11 Schima species were resolved with strong support based on the cp genome data set, which corresponds well with the species distribution pattern. The data presented here will serve as a foundation to facilitate species identification, DNA barcoding and phylogenetic reconstructions for future exploration of Schima.},

	abstract = {During the past three decades, molecular taxonomy has made considerable changes in the systematic delimitations of several families in the order Ericales which were formed earlier based on morphology. For instance, the Pentaphylacaceae s.l. has been treated differently by both modern and traditional taxonomists. Modern molecular taxonomists constituted this family by combining the traditionally defined Pentaphylacaceae s.s. (Pentaphylax), Sladeniaceae s.s. (Sladenia), the subfamily Ternstroemioideae with 11 genera of Theaceae s.l. and the genus Ficalhoa. There are also treatments placing the genus Pentaphylax with Ternstroemioideae in Pentaphylacaceae and Ficalhoa with Sladenia in Sladeniaceae. Because most of these genera are poorly studied, investigations on all aspects are important to understand the phylogeny to settle the issues surrounding the treatment of the 14 genera in this family. In the present study, DNA sequences of nrITS and trnL-F genes from species of 11 genera from these 14 genera were generated and analyzed together with sequences from other closely related members of Ericales. The results suggested existence of four distinct lineages viz., Sladenia, Pentaphylax, and tribes Frezierieae (9 genera) and Ternstroemieae (2 genera). Further, it demonstrated that within the biggest lineage, Frezierieae, the Visnea remained sister to the clades Adinandra+Cleyera, Euryodendron+Symplococarpon, Freziera, and finally, Eurya. Based on the evidence, it can be concluded that Sladeniaceae and Pentaphylacaceae are very close to each other and the proposal of merging them into a mega family Pentaphylacaceae s.l. with four tribes, i.e., Sladenieae, Pentaphylaceae, Ternstroemieae, and Freziereae should be considered seriously.},

	abstract = {Tectaria (Tectariaceae) is one of the most confusing fern genera in terms of its circumscription and phylogeny. Since its original description, a number of genera had been moved into or related with this genus, while others had been segregated from it. Tectaria is also among the largest fern genera, comprising 150-210 mostly tropical species. Previous molecular studies have been far from comprehensive (sampling no more than 76 accessions from 52 species), limited in geographic scope (mainly restricted to Asia), and based exclusively on plastid markers. In the present study, DNA sequences of eight plastid and one nuclear marker of 360 accessions representing ca. 130 species of Tectaria, ca. 36 species of six non-Tectaria genera in Tectariaceae, 12 species of Davalliaceae, Oleandraceae, and Polypodiaceae, and 13 species of Lomariopsidaceae were used to infer a phylogeny with maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony approaches. Our major results include: (1) the most recently proposed circumscription of Tectaria is strongly supported as monophyletic; (2) the genera Lenda, Microbrochis, Phlebiogonium, and Sagenia, sampled here for the first time, are resolved as part of Tectaria; (3) four superclades representing early splits in Tectaria are identified, with the Old World species being sister to the New World species; (4) 12 well-supported major clades in Tectaria are revealed, differing from one another in molecular, morphological, and geographical features; (5) evolution of 13 morphological characters is inferred in a phylogenetic context and morphological synapomorphies of various clades are identified; and in particular (6) free venation in Tectaria is inferred to be repeatedly derived from anastomosing venation, an evolutionary phenomenon not documented previously in vascular plants in a phylogenetic context based on both plastid and nuclear evidence.},

Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference are used to analyze 115 individuals, representing ca. 56 species of Tectaria s.l. and 36 species of ten related genera. The results strongly support the monophyly of Tectaria in a broad sense, in which Ctenitopsis, Hemigramma, Heterogonium, Psomiocarpa, Quercifilix, Stenosemia, and Tectaridium should be submerged. Such broadly circumscribed Tectaria is supported by the arising pattern of veinlets and the base chromosome number (x=40). Four primary clades are well resolved within Tectaria, one from the Neotropic (T. trifoliata clade) and three from the Old World (T. subtriphylla clade, Ctenitopsis clade, and T. crenata clade). Tectaria crenata clade is the largest one including six subclades. Of the genera previously recognized as tectarioid ferns, Ctenitis, Lastreopsis, and Pleocnemia, are confirmed to be members in Dryopteridaceae; while Pteridrys and Triplophyllum are supported in Tectariaceae. To infer morphological evolution, 13 commonly used characters are optimized on the resulting phylogenetic trees and in result, are all homoplastic in Tectaria.},

	abstract = {Phylogeny of the Taxaceae genera and the monotypic family Cephalotaxaceae has been extraordinarily controversial. In this paper chloroplast matK genes and nuclear ITS sequences were determined for all six genera of the two families and representatives of other conifer families. Analysis using either the nonsynonymous sites or the deduced amino acid sequences of matK genes strongly indicates that taxad genera and Cephalotaxaceae are monophyletic, with the Taxodiaceae/Cupressaceae clade as their sister group. Cephalotaxus is basal to the taxad genera, among which two clades, Torreya/Amentotaxus and Taxus/Pseudotaxus/Austrotaxus, are resolved. They correspond to Janchen's two tribes, Torreyeae and Taxeae. In Taxeae, Austrotaxus is the first to branch off. Analyses of the nuclear ITS sequence data corroborated the topology of the matK gene tree. These results refute the views that Cephalotaxaceae has no alliance with Taxaceae and that Austrotaxus and Amentotaxus should be excluded from the Taxaceae. We estimated the divergence time between the Taxodiaceae/Cupressaceae and the Cephalotaxaceae/Taxaceae clades to be 192-230 Myr ago and the divergence time between taxads and Cephalotaxus to be 149-179 Myr ago. Soon after the latter divergence event, within 6-8 Myr, the two taxad tribes originated. In conclusion, our data do not support Florin's claim that taxads could be traced to Devonian psilophytes (359-395 Myr ago).},

Phylogenetic analyses of 111 species of Symplocos based on the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the chloroplast genes rpl16, matK, and trnL-trnF yielded topologies in which only one of the four traditionally recognized subgenera (Epigenia; Neotropics) is monophyletic. Section Cordyloblaste (subgenus Symplocos; eastern Asia) is monophyletic and sister to a group comprising all other samples of Symplocos.

Symplocos wikstroemiifolia (eastern Asia) and S. tinctoria (southeastern United States), both of subgenus Hopea, form a clade that groups with S. longipes (tropical North America) and the species of subgenus Epigenia. The remaining samples of subgenus Hopea (eastern Asia) form a clade. Section Neosymplocos (subgenus Microsymplocos; Neotropics) is well nested within a clade otherwise comprising the samples of section Symplocastrum (subgenus Symplocos; Neotropics). Section Urbaniocharis (subgenus Microsymplocos; Antilles) groups as sister to the clade comprising Symplocastrum and Neosymplocos. The data support the independent evolution of deciduousness among section Palura and S. tinctoria. The early initial divergence of sections Cordyloblaste and Palura from the main group warrants their recognition at taxonomic levels higher than those at which they are currently placed. An inferred eastern Asian origin for Symplocos with subsequent dispersal to the Americas is consistent with patterns from other phylogenetic studies of eastern Asian-American disjunct plant groups but contrary to a North American origin inferred from the earliest fossil occurrences of the genus.},

The evolution of morphological characters is discussed on the basis of the phylogenetic relationships obtained. All species were Asian, except one, S. austromexicana, from Mexico. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and two intergenic spacer regions, between trnL and trnF, and between trnH and psbA of chloroplast DNA were used. The topologies of trees obtained from ITS and the chloroplast intergenic spacers are largely congruent. S. sonoharae, the representative of the subgenus Symplocos in Asia, was sister to all other species. The position of the American species, S. austromexicana, which also belongs to the subgenus Symplocos, was not well resolved. The phylogenetic tree based on combined sequence data largely supports the monophyletic origin of the infrageneric sections proposed earlier. However, the phylogenetic relationship between them is not well resolved, probably due to rapid diversification. The section Palura, a deciduous group, is well defined in the DNA analysis, suggesting its independent status in the genus Symplocos. In spite of their morphological divergence, the three endemic species of the Bonin Islands are monophyletic. The occurrence of curved seeds seems to be homoplastic, scattered over the phylogenetic tree without showing a particular infrageneric relationship.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The genus Sinojackia consists of eight species, all endemic to China. All species of Sinojackia are endangered or threatened owing to poor recruitment within populations. Information on molecular phylogenetics is critical for developing successful conservation strategies for this genus. METHODS Combined DNA sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions and plastid psbA-trnH intergenic spacer and microsatellite data were used to infer a phylogeny of the genus. KEY RESULTS Parsimony analysis of the combined sequence data and multivariate analysis based on fruit characters indicated that Sinojackia dolichocarpa is monophyletic and genetically well separated from the other Sinojackia species, thus supporting its rank at the generic level as Changiostyrax. Phylogenetic relationships within Sinojackia sensu stricto are unresolved from the combined sequence data. A UPGMA dendrogram based on seven microsatellite loci of 96 individual plants yielded a first-diverging cluster of all individuals of S. microcarpa. The remaining species form another cluster without any definitive patterns corresponding to current species circumscriptions, suggesting either extensive hybridization or incipient speciation. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that there are too many species recognized within Sinojackia sensu stricto, but this must be further assessed with comprehensive morphological and taxonomic revisionary work. The implications of the phylogenetic data for conservation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships within the flowering plant genus Styrax were investigated with DNA sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) and with chloroplast DNA restriction site data from the genes trnK, rpoC1, and rpoC2. The data sets from each genome were analyzed separately and in combination with parsimony methods. The results strongly support the monophyly of each of the four series of the genus but provide little phylogenetic resolution among them. Reticulate evolution may at least partly explain discordance between the molecular phylogenetic estimates and a prior morphological estimate within series Cyrta. The historical biogeography of the genus was inferred with unweighted parsimony character optimization of trees recovered from a combined ITS and morphological data set, after a series of combinability tests for data set congruence was conducted. The results are consistent with the fossil record in supporting a Eurasian origin of Styrax. The nested phylogenetic position of the South American members of the genus within those from southern North America and Eurasia suggests that the boreotropics hypothesis best explains the amphi-Pacific tropical disjunct distribution occurring within section Valvatae. The pattern of relationship recovered among the species of section Styrax ((western North America + western Eurasia) (eastern North America + eastern Eurasia)) is rare among north-temperate Tertiary forest relicts. The monophyly of the group of species from western North America and western Eurasia provides qualified support for the Madrean-Tethyan hypothesis, which posits a Tertiary floristic connection among the semiarid regions in which these taxa occur. A single vicariance event between eastern Asia and eastern North America accounts for the pattern of relationship among intercontinental disjuncts in series Cyrta.},

	abstract = {The genus Croomia (Stemonaceae) comprises three herbaceous perennial species that are distributed in temperate-deciduous forests in Southeastern North America (C.pauciflora) and East Asia (C. japonica, C. heterosepala). The two Asian species have abutting ranges in South Japan, but C. japonica also occurs disjunctively on the adjacent Asiatic mainland in East China. In our phylogenetic analysis of Croomia, based on chloroplast (cp) DNA sequence variation of the trnL-F region, and rooted with Stemona spp., the two Asian species are identified as sister that likely diverged in the Mid-to-Late Pleistocene (0.84-0.13 mya), whereas the divergence of C. pauciflora dates back to the Late Plio-/Pleistocene ({\textless}2.6 mya). Phylogeographical analysis of the two East Asian species detected seven cpDNA (trnL-F) haplotypes across 16 populations surveyed, and all of those were fixed for a particular cpDNA haplotype (H(E)=0.0, G(ST)=1). A survey of inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) markers also detected remarkably low levels of within-population diversity (C. japonica: H(E)=0.085; C. heterosepala: H(E)=0.125), and high levels of inter-population differentiation (C. japonica: Phi(ST)=0.736; C. heterosepala: Phi(ST)=0.550), at least partly due to pronounced regional genetic substructure within both species. Non-overlapping distributions of cpDNA haplotypes and strong genetic (cpDNA/ISSR) differentiation among populations and/or regions accord with findings of a nested clade analysis, which inferred allopatric fragmentation as the major process influencing the spatial haplotype distribution of the two species. Based on mismatch distribution analysis and neutrality tests, we do not find evidence of population expansion in both species. Overall, we conclude that components of temperate-deciduous forest types in South Japan and East China are particularly sensitive to range fragmentation, isolation, and enhanced (incipient) species formation through climate-induced expansions of other forest types over glacial and interglacial periods of the (Late) Quaternary.},

	abstract = {The complex evolutionary history of the subtribe Physalinae is reflected in the poor resolution of the relationships of Physalis and the physaloid genera. We hypothesize that this low resolution is caused by recent evolutionary history in a complex geographic setting. The aims of this study were twofold: (1) To determine the phylogenetic relationships of the current genera recognized in Physalinae in order to identify monophyletic groups and resolve the physaloid grade; and (2) to determine the probable causes of the recent divergence in Physalinae. We conducted phylogenetic analyses with maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference with 50 Physalinae species and 19 others as outgroups, using morphological and molecular data from five plastid and two nuclear regions. A relaxed molecular clock was obtained from the ML topology and ancestral area reconstruction was conducted using the DEC model. The genera Chamaesaracha, Leucophysalis, and Physalis subgenus Rydbergis were recovered as monophyletic. Three clades, Alkekengi-Calliphysalis, Schraderanthus-Tzeltalia, and Witheringia-Brachistus, also received good support. However, even with morphological data and that of the DNA of seven regions, the tree was not completely resolved and many clades remained unsupported. Physalinae diverged at the end of the Miocene (∼9.22Mya) with one trend indicating that the greatest diversification within the subtribe occurred during the last 5My. The Neotropical region presented the highest probability (45\%) of being the ancestral area of Physalinae followed by the Mexican Transition Zone (35\%). During the Pliocene and Pleistocene, the geographical areas where species were found experienced significant geological and climatic changes, giving rise to rapid and relatively recent diversification events in Physalinae. Thus, recent origin, high diversification, and morphological complexity have contributed, at least with the currently available methods, to the inability to completely disentangle the phylogenetic relationships of Physalinae.},

Hyoscyameae and Mandragoreae are the only tribes of this family distributed exclusively in Eurasia with two centers of diversity: the Mediterranean-Turanian (MT) region and the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this study, we examined the origins and biogeographical diversifications of the two tribes based on the phylogenetic framework and chronogram inferred from a combined data set of six plastid DNA regions (the atpB gene, the ndhF gene, the rps16-trnK intergenic spacer, the rbcL gene, the trnC-psbM region and the psbA-trnH intergenic spacer) with two fossil calibration points. Our data suggest that Hyoscyameae and Mandragoreae each forms a monophyletic group independently derived from different New World lineages in the early Miocene. Phylogenetic relationships within both tribes are generally well resolved. All genera of Hyoscyameae are found to be monophyletic and they diversified in middle to late Miocene. At nearly the same time, Mandragoreae split into two clades, corresponding to the MT region and the TP region, respectively. Both the phylogenetic relationships and the estimated ages of Hyoscyameae and Mandragoreae support two independent dispersal events of their ancestors from the New World into Eurasia. After their arrivals in Eurasia, the two tribes diversified primarily in the MT region and in the TP region via multiple biogeographic processes including vicariance, dispersal, recolonization or being preserved as relicts, from the mid Miocene to the late Quaternary.},

The monophyly of Nolana was strongly supported by all molecular data. The LEAFY data suggested that the Chilean species, including Nolana sessiliflora, the N. acuminata group and at least some members of the Alona group, are basally diverged, supporting the Chilean origin of the genus. Three well-supported clades in the LEAFY tree were corroborated by the SINE (short interspersed elements) or SINE-like insertions. Taxa from Peru are grouped roughly into two clades. Nolana galapagensis from the Galápagos Island is most likely to have derived from a Peruvian ancestor. The monophyly of the morphologically well-diagnosed Nolana acuminata group (N. acuminata, N. baccata, N. paradoxa, N. parviflora, N. pterocarpa, N. rupicola and N. elegans) was supported by both plastid and LEAFY data. Incongruence between the plastid and the LEAFY data was detected concerning primarily the positions of N. sessiliflora, N. galapagensis, taxa of the Alona group and the two Peruvian clades. Such incongruence may be due to reticulate evolution or in some cases lineage sorting of plastid DNA. Incongruence between our previous GBSSI trees and the plastid-LEAFY trees was also detected concerning two well-supported major clades in the GBSSI tree. Duplication of the GBSSI gene may have contributed to this incongruence.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Solanum section Herpystichum is a lineage that comprises both widespread and very narrowly distributed species. This study investigates the phylogenetic relationships of sect. Herpystichum and evaluates several phylogenetic methods for analysis of multiple sequences. METHODS Sequence data from seven nuclear (ITS, GBSSI, and five COSII) and three plastid (psbA-trnH, trnT-trnF, and trnS-trnG) regions were concatenated and analyzed under maximum parsimony and Bayesian criteria. In addition, we used two analytical methods that take into account differences in topologies resulting from the analyses of the individual markers: Bayesian Estimation of Species Trees (BEST) and supertree analysis. KEY RESULTS The monophyletic Solanum sect. Herpystichum was resolved with moderate support in the concatenated maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses and the supertree analysis, and relationships within the section were well-resolved and strongly supported. The BEST topology, however, was poorly resolved. Also, because of how BEST deals with missing sequences, {\textgreater}25\% of our accessions, including two species, had to be excluded from the analyses. Our results indicate a progenitor-descendent relationship with two species nested within the widespread S. evolvulifolium. CONCLUSIONS Analytical methods that consider individual topologies are important for studies based on multiple molecular markers. On the basis of analyses in this study, BEST had the serious shortcoming that taxa with missing sequences must be removed from the analysis or they can produce spurious topologies. Supertree analysis provided a good alternative for our data by allowing the inclusion of all 10 species of sect. Herpystichum.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The Solanaceae is a plant family of great economic importance. Despite a wealth of phylogenetic work on individual clades and a deep knowledge of particular cultivated species such as tomato and potato, a robust evolutionary framework with a dated molecular phylogeny for the family is still lacking. Here we investigate molecular divergence times for Solanaceae using a densely-sampled species-level phylogeny. We also review the fossil record of the family to derive robust calibration points, and estimate a chronogram using an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock. RESULTS Our densely-sampled phylogeny shows strong support for all previously identified clades of Solanaceae and strongly supported relationships between the major clades, particularly within Solanum. The Tomato clade is shown to be sister to section Petota, and the Regmandra clade is the first branching member of the Potato clade. The minimum age estimates for major splits within the family provided here correspond well with results from previous studies, indicating splits between tomato and potato around 8 Million years ago (Ma) with a 95\% highest posterior density (HPD) 7-10 Ma, Solanum and Capsicum c. 19 Ma (95\% HPD 17-21), and Solanum and Nicotiana c. 24 Ma (95\% HPD 23-26). CONCLUSIONS Our large time-calibrated phylogeny provides a significant step towards completing a fully sampled species-level phylogeny for Solanaceae, and provides age estimates for the whole family. The chronogram now includes 40\% of known species and all but two monotypic genera, and is one of the best sampled angiosperm family phylogenies both in terms of taxon sampling and resolution published thus far. The increased resolution in the chronogram combined with the large increase in species sampling will provide much needed data for the examination of many biological questions using Solanaceae as a model system.},

Several studies have included molecular data in phylogenetic reconstructions of this genus, but all of them have failed to include all taxa and/or analyzed few genetic markers. In the present study, we employed the most inclusive genetic and taxonomic datasets for the genus, aiming to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Petunia based on molecular phylogeny, biogeographic distribution, and character evolution. We included all 20 Petunia morphological species or subspecies in these analyses. Based on nine nuclear and five plastid DNA markers, our phylogenetic analysis reinforces the monophyly of the genus Petunia and supports the hypothesis that the basal divergence is more related to the differentiation of corolla tube length, whereas the geographic distribution of species is more related to divergences within these main clades. Ancestral area reconstructions suggest the Pampas region as the area of origin and earliest divergence in Petunia. The state reconstructions suggest that the ancestor of Petunia might have had a short corolla tube and a bee pollination floral syndrome.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Quaternary climatic changes led to variations in sea level and these variations played a significant role in the generation of marine terrace deposits in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain. The main consequence of the increase in sea level was local extinction or population displacement, such that coastal species would be found around the new coastline. Our main goal was to investigate the effects of sea level changes on the geographical structure and variability of genetic lineages from a Petunia species endemic to the South Atlantic Coastal Plain. We employed a phylogeographic approach based on plastid sequences obtained from individuals collected from the complete geographic distribution of Petunia integrifolia ssp. depauperata and its sister group. We used population genetics tests to evaluate the degree of genetic variation and structure among and within populations, and we used haplotype network analysis and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to estimate divergence times and population growth. RESULTS We observed three major genetic lineages whose geographical distribution may be related to different transgression/regression events that occurred in this region during the Pleistocene. The divergence time between the monophyletic group P. integrifolia ssp. depauperata and its sister group (P. integrifolia ssp. integrifolia) was compatible with geological estimates of the availability of the coastal plain. Similarly, the origin of each genetic lineage is congruent with geological estimates of habitat availability. CONCLUSIONS Diversification of P. integrifolia ssp. depauperata possibly occurred as a consequence of the marine transgression/regression cycles during the Pleistocene. In periods of high sea level, plants were most likely restricted to a refuge area corresponding to fossil dunes and granitic hills, from which they colonized the coast once the sea level came down. The modern pattern of lineage geographical distribution and population variation was established by a range expansion with serial founder effects conditioned on soil availability.},

	abstract = {One classic explanation for the remarkable diversity of flower colors across angiosperms involves evolutionary shifts among different types of pollinators with different color preferences. However, the pollinator shift model fails to account for the many examples of color variation within clades that share the same pollination system. An alternate explanation is the competition model, which suggests that color divergence evolves in response to interspecific competition for pollinators, as a means to decrease interspecific pollinator movements. This model predicts color overdispersion within communities relative to null assemblages. Here, we combine morphometric analyses, field surveys, and models of pollinator vision with a species-level phylogeny to test the competition model in the primarily hummingbird-pollinated clade Iochrominae (Solanaceae). Results show that flower color as perceived by pollinators is significantly overdispersed within sites. This pattern is not simply due to phylogenetic history: phylogenetic community structure does not deviate from random expectations, and flower color lacks phylogenetic signal. Moreover, taxa that occur in sympatry occupy a significantly larger volume of color space than those in allopatry, supporting the hypothesis that competition in sympatry drove the evolution of novel colors. We suggest that competition among close relatives may commonly underlie floral divergence, especially in species-rich habitats where congeners frequently co-occur.},

However, the accumulation of such multi-locus data sets brings its own challenges, given that gene trees do not necessarily represent the true species tree. Using genomic tools developed for Solanum (Solanaceae), we have evaluated the utility of nuclear conserved ortholog set II (COSII) regions for phylogenetic inference in tribe Lycieae (Solanaceae). Five COSII regions, with intronic contents ranging from 68\% to 91\%, were sequenced in 10 species. Their phylogenetic utility was assessed and compared with data from more commonly used nuclear (GBSSI, nrITS) and cpDNA spacer data. We compared the effectiveness of a traditional total evidence concatenation approach versus the recently developed Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) method to infer species trees given multiple independent gene trees. All of the sampled COSII regions had high numbers of parsimony-informative (PI) characters, and two of the COSII regions had more PI characters than the GBSSI, ITS, and cpDNA spacer data sets combined. COSII markers are a promising new tool for phylogenetic inference in Solanaceae, and should be explored in related groups. Both the concatenation and BEST approaches yielded similar topologies; however, when multiple individuals with polyphyletic alleles were included, BEST was clearly the more robust approach for inferring species trees in the presence of gene tree incongruence.},

Using data from four regions of three low-copy nuclear genes, nuclear ribosomal DNA, and regions of the plastid genome, we have reconstructed the evolutionary origin of sect.

Noctiflorae that also contained introgressed DNA from the other, or a hypothetical hybrid species between these two sections, was the maternal progenitor.

These processes represent challenges for the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships between species, because they cannot be represented adequately with bifurcating trees. We use data from low-copy nuclear genes to evaluate long-standing hypotheses of homoploid (interspecific) hybrid speciation in Nicotiana (Solanaceae) and reconstruct a complex series of reticulation events that have been important in the evolutionary history of this genus. Hybrid origins for three diploid species (Nicotiana glauca, N. linearis, and N. spegazzinii) are inferred on the basis of gene tree incongruence, evidence for interallelic recombination between likely parental alleles, and support for incompatible splits in Lento plots. Phylogenetic analysis of recombinant gene sequences illustrates that recombinants may be resolved with one of their progenitor lineages with a high posterior probability under Bayesian inference, and thus there is no indication of the conflict between phylogenetic signals that results from reticulation. Our results illustrate the importance of hybridization in shaping evolution in Nicotiana and also show that intragenic recombination may be relatively common. This finding demonstrates that it is important to investigate the possibility of recombination when aiming to detect hybrids from DNA-sequence data and reconstruct patterns of reticulate evolution between species.},

	abstract = {Advances in sequencing technology have made it possible to produce large multi-locus datasets required for species tree analyses. One challenge with constructing high throughput sequencing datasets, however, is that missing information is propagated at different steps in the sequence preparation process. To date, species tree studies have focused on filtering and removing errors that occur at particular loci. Given the way that high throughput sequencing datasets are constructed, however, large amounts of error or ambiguity may also manifest across individuals. Here we use a novel tree-based multivariate clustering method to identify and remove individuals with low phylogenetic signal in a nuclear sequence capture dataset for the Iochrominae clade (Solanaceae). Our results suggest that the low quality tips are the result of the library preparation process (e.g. unequal pooling) rather than poor capture due to phylogenetic distance from the reference species. After implementing the clustering approach and removing low quality tips, we construct an Iochrominae species tree that resolves a number of unknown relationships. We propose this pipeline as a valuable tool for species tree reconstruction with phylogenomic datasets containing variable levels of missing data.},

Among them, only Lycium sandwicense A. Gray sporadically occurs widely on oceanic islands in the Pacific Ocean. To investigate phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships of the genus with emphasis on L. sandwicense, the coding region of matK, the two intergenic spacers trnT (UGU)-trnL (UAA) and trnL (UAA)-trnF (GAA), and the trnL (UAA) intron of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) were sequenced. A strict consensus tree resulting from the phylogenetic analysis indicates the following: (1) New World species comprise a potentially paraphyletic assemblage; (2) southern African, Australian, and Eurasian species together are monophyletic; (3) southern African species are a paraphyletic assemblage; and (4) L. sandwicense is in a clade with certain New World species.

An earlier morphological revision of the c. 50 species recognized three main groups, one consisting of the 23 Antillean species, another of southern South American and Andean species, and a third of species from the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield. Based on plastid and nuclear DNA sequences from up to 65 accessions representing 80\% of the species, we generated a phylogeny and a calibrated chronogram for Brunfelsia to infer clade expansion and shifts in pollinators and fruit types. Brunfelsia flowers offer nectar, and attract lepidoptera, hummingbirds, or bees; the fruits are dry or fleshy. Our results imply that Brunfelsia is 16-21 Myr old and entered the Antilles from South America early during its history, with subsequent expansion along the island arc. The ancestor of the Antillean clade was hawk-moth-pollinated and had fleshy capsules, perhaps facilitating dispersal by birds. The only shift to hummingbird pollination occurred on Cuba, which also harbors the largest single radiation, with 11 species (10 included in our study) that apparently arose over the past 4 Myr. Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico each sustained smaller radiations. The data also reveal at least one new species.},

The taxonomy of Deprea has been unstable after controversial hypotheses about its position and circumscription. Additionally, biogeographical inferences are only based on observations of the restricted area of distribution of some species and no ancestral area estimation have been performed. Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis and an ancestral area reconstruction of Deprea in order to establish its circumscription, resolve its position within Physalideae, and reconstruct its biogeographical history. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Forty-three Deprea species and 26 related taxa were sampled for three DNA markers (psbA-trnH, ITS, and waxy). A Bayesian binary MCMC model was applied in order to infer ancestral areas. Deprea is resolved as a strongly supported monophyletic group according to its current circumscription and is placed within subtribe Withaninae of Physalideae. The phylogenetic relationships enabled us to solve taxonomic problems including the rejection and acceptance of previous synonyms. The most probable ancestral area for Deprea is the Northern Andes of South America and the Amotape-Huancabamba zone. Our phylogeny provides increased resolution and support for the current position and circumscription of Deprea. Better resolution of interspecific relationships was also obtained, although some affinities remain unclear. The phylogenetic and ancestral area reconstructions provide a framework for addressing taxonomic problems and investigating new evolutionary questions.},

Parsimony and Bayesian analyses yielded identical relationships for the diploids, and these are consistent with other data, producing the best-supported phylogenetic assessment currently available for the genus. For the allopolyploids, the line of maternal inheritance is traced via the plastid tree. Nicotiana and the Australian endemic tribe Anthocercideae form a sister pair. Symonanthus is sister to the rest of Anthocercideae. Nicotiana sect. Tomentosae is sister to the rest of the genus. The maternal parent of the allopolyploid species of N. sect.

We sequenced a fragment (containing four introns) of the nuclear gene 'chloroplast-expressed glutamine synthetase' (ncpGS) in 65 species of Nicotiana. Here we present the first phylogenetic analysis based on a low-copy nuclear gene for this well studied and important genus. Diploid species have a single-copy of ncpGS, and allotetraploids as expected have two homeologous copies, each derived from their progenitor diploid. Results were particularly useful for determining the paternal lineage of previously enigmatic taxa (for which our previous analyses had revealed only the maternal progenitors). In particular, we were able to shed light on the origins of the two oldest and largest allotetraploid sections, N. sects. Suaveolentes and Repandae. All homeologues have an intact reading frame and apparently similar rates of divergence, suggesting both remain functional. Difficulties in fitting certain diploid species into the sectional classification of Nicotiana on morphological grounds, coupled with discordance between the ncpGS data and previous trees (i.e. plastid, nuclear ribosomal DNA), indicate a number of homoploid (diploid) hybrids in the genus. We have evidence for Nicotiana glutinosa and Nicotiana linearis being of hybrid origin and patterns of intra-allelic recombination also indicate the possibility of reticulate origins for other diploid species.},

The maximum parsimony method was used to calculate strict consensus trees based on nucleotide sequences in selected regions of the Hf1 locus. Petunia taxa were divided into two major clades in the phylogenetic trees. Petunia axillaris (including three subspecies), P. exserta, and P. occidentalis formed a clade with 100\% bootstrap support. This clade is associated with a consistently inflexed pedicel, self-compatibility in most taxa, and geographical distribution in southern and western portions of the genus range. The other clade, which comprised the remainder of the genus is, however, less supported (up to 71\% bootstrap); it is characterized by a deflexed pedicel in the fruiting state (except P. inflata), self-incompatibility, and a northeastern distribution. A nuclear gene, Hf1, seems to be a useful molecular marker for elucidating the phylogeny of the genus Petunia when compared with the nucleotide sequence of trnK intron of chloroplast DNA.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships in the genus Nicotiana were investigated using parsimony analyses of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA). In addition, origins of some amphidiploid taxa in Nicotiana were investigated using the techniques of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), and the results of both sets of analyses were used to evaluate previous hypotheses about the origins of these taxa. Phylogenetic analyses of the ITS nrDNA data were performed on the entire genus (66 of 77 naturally occurring species, plus three artificial hybrids), comprising both diploid and polyploid taxa, and on the diploid taxa only (35 species) to examine the effects of amphidiploids on estimates of relationships. All taxa, regardless of ploidy, produced clean, single copies of the ITS region, even though some taxa are hybrids. Results are compared with a published plastid (matK) phylogeny using fewer, but many of the same, taxa. The patterns of relationships in Nicotiana, as seen in both analyses, are largely congruent with each other and previous evolutionary ideas based on morphology and cytology, but some important differences are apparent. None of the currently recognized subgenera of Nicotiana is monophyletic and, although most of the currently recognized sections are coherent, others are clearly polyphyletic. Relying solely upon ITS nrDNA analysis to reveal phylogenetic patterns in a complex genus such as Nicotiana is insufficient, and it is clear that conventional analysis of single data sets, such as ITS, is likely to be misleading in at least some respects about evolutionary history. ITS sequences of natural and well-documented amphidiploids are similar or identical to one of their two parents-usually, but not always, the maternal parent-and are not in any sense themselves 'hybrid'. Knowing how ITS evolves in artificial amphidiploids gives insight into what ITS analysis might reveal about naturally occurring amphidiploids of unknown origin, and it is in this perspective that analysis of ITS sequences is highly informative.},

This study aimed to resolve this uncertainty using molecular evidence. METHODS Phylogenetic trees of 52 taxa of Petunia sensu Jussieu were constructed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of chloroplast DNA digested with 19 restriction enzymes and hybridized with 12 cloned Nicotiana chloroplast DNA fragments as probes. KEY RESULTS In all, 89 phylogenetically informative RFLPs were detected and one 50 \% majority consensus tree was obtained, using the maximum parsimony method, and one distance matrix tree, using the neighbour joining method. Petunia sensu Wijsman and Calibrachoa were monophyletic sister clades in both trees. Calibrachoa parviflora and C. pygmaea, previously thought to differ from the other species in terms of their cross-compatibility, seed morphology, and nuclear DNA content, formed a basal clade that was sister to the remainder of Calibrachoa. Several clades found in the phylogenetic trees corresponded to their distribution ranges, suggesting that recent speciation in the genus Petunia sensu Jussieu occurred independently in several different regions. CONCLUSIONS The separation of Petunia sensu Wijsman and Calibrachoa was supported by chloroplast DNA analysis. Two groups in the Calibrachoa were also recognized with a high degree of confidence.},

METHODS We analyzed 33 populations sampled from California and throughout the eastern United States using AFLP and chloroplast DNA sequence data. KEY RESULTS Individuals of S. jamesii from northern California formed a clade sister to the eastern North American species, and they likely diverged from each other during the Pleistocene. Among the eastern species, two lineages were found on opposite sides of the Appalachian Mountains. The populations near the "Driftless Area" contained most of the chlorotypes found in the Midwest, including a unique one endemic to this area, and the AFLP data indicated that one population from this area has the highest frequency-down-weighted-marker value. CONCLUSIONS This study, and others that have focused on mammals, amphibians, and woody plants, provides further evidence for the debate over whether the upper Midwest's "Driftless Area" may have hosted a biologically diverse northern glacial refugium. Herbaceous species of Smilax from eastern North American exhibit an Appalachian discontinuity. They appear to have persisted in multiple refugia both east and west of the Appalachians, with several populations persisting in situ through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We suggest that they experienced localized expansion after the LGM, possibly followed by subsequent contact between the Midwest and the East Coastal lineages.},

	abstract = {Tethyan plant disjunctions, including Mediterranean-African-Asian disjunctions, are thought to be vicariant, but their temporal origin and underlying causes remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of Smilax aspera, a hypothesized component of the European Tertiary laurel forest flora. Thirty-eight populations and herbarium specimens representing 57 locations across the species range were sequenced at seven plastid regions and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region. Time-calibrated phylogenetic and phylogeographic inferences were used to trace ancestral areas and biogeographical events. The deep intraspecific split between Mediterranean and African-Asian lineages is attributable to range fragmentation of a southern Tethyan ancestor, as colder and more arid climates developed shortly after the mid-Miocene. In the Mediterranean, climate-induced vicariance has shaped regional population structure since the Late Miocene/Early Pliocene. At around the same time, East African and South Asian lineages split by vicariance, with one shared haplotype reflecting long-distance dispersal. Our results support the idea that geographic range formation and divergence of Tertiary relict species are more or less gradual (mostly vicariant) processes over long time spans, rather than point events in history. They also highlight the importance of the Mediterranean Basin as a centre of intraspecific divergence for Tertiary relict plants.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ympev.2017.11.024},
	abstract = {Generic circumscriptions in the mostly pantropical family Simaroubaceae are somewhat controversial. Simaba is the largest genus, currently defined as exclusively neotropical, with around 25 species of trees and shrubs, but both its limits and infrageneric classification have been a matter of discussion and divergence. Traditionally, species of the genus have been treated in three sections: Simaba sect. Tenuiflorae, S. sect. Floribundae and S. sect. Grandiflorae, but a phylogenetic analysis suggested that the latter two may not be monophyletic. To test the monophyly of Simaba and its infrageneric classification, we used a molecular approach based on DNA sequence data from two nuclear ribosomal spacer regions (ITS and ETS) and three plastid regions (rps16 intron, and intergenic spacers psbA-trnH and trnL-trnF), including a comprehensive sampling of species from Simaba and closely related genera. We also performed ancestral character reconstructions to identify morphological characters that could serve as synapomorphies for major clades and to explore patterns of homoplasy in the morphological dataset. Our results show Simaba as traditionally circumscribed is not monophyletic, with taxa segregated into two strongly supported but distinct clades, one of which is more closely related to Simarouba. The three main clades that emerged in the phylogeny include a mostly Amazonian Simaba clade (which includes the type species of Simaba and the remaining species of S. sect. Tenuiflorae, here proposed to be recognized as Simaba sensu stricto), a mostly extra-Amazonian Simaba clade (a distinct lineage that will be recognized as Homalolepis, a genus currently treated in synonymy and equivalent to Simaba sections Grandiflorae and Floribundae), and the Simarouba clade (including all of its current species). These three clades are characterized by a combination of morphological characters, described in detail herein, some of which are novel features for Simaba not previously reported in the literature. Mapping character-states on the phylogenetic tree provides tests for evolutionary hypotheses. For example, our reconstruction of habit and geographic distribution suggests that the diversification of several shrubby species within the extra-Amazonian lineage in the South American cerrados probably occurred from ancestors inhabiting tropical forests, involving transitions in morphological and ecological traits.},

	doi = {10.1093/sysbio/syp041},
	abstract = {Detailed biogeographic studies of pantropical clades are still relatively few, and those conducted to date typically use parsimony or event-based methods to reconstruct ancestral areas. In this study, a recently developed likelihood method for reconstructing ancestral areas (the dispersal-extinction cladogenesis [DEC] model) is applied to the angiosperm family Simaroubaceae, a geographically widespread and ecologically diverse clade of pantropical and temperate trees and shrubs. To estimate divergence dates in the family, Bayesian uncorrelated rates analyses and robust fossil calibrations are applied to the well-sampled and strongly supported phylogeny. For biogeographic analyses, the effects of parameter configurations in the DEC model are assessed for different possible ancestral ranges, and the likelihood method is compared with dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA). Regardless of the parameters used, likelihood analyses show a common pattern of multiple recent range shifts that overshadow reconstruction of events deeper in the family's history. DIVA produced results similar to the DEC model when ancestral ranges were restricted to two areas, but some improbable ancestral ranges were also observed. Simaroubaceae exhibit an early history of range expansion between major continental areas in the Northern Hemisphere, but reconstruction of ancestral areas for lineages diverging in the early Tertiary are sensitive to the parameters of the model used. A North American origin is suggested for the family, with migration via Beringia by ancestral taxa. In contrast to traditional views, long-distance dispersal events are common, particularly in the Late Oligocene and later. Notable dispersals are inferred to have occurred across the Atlantic Ocean in both directions, as well as between Africa and Asia, and around the Indian Ocean basin and Pacific islands.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The cosmopolitan lycophyte family Selaginellaceae, dating back to the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous, is notorious for its many species with a seemingly undifferentiated gross morphology. This morphological stasis has for a long time hampered our understanding of the evolutionary history of the single genus Selaginella. Here we present a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of Selaginella, and based on the resulting phylogeny, we discuss morphological evolution in the group. METHODS We sampled about one-third of the approximately 750 recognized Selaginella species. Evolutionary relationships were inferred from both chloroplast (rbcL) and single-copy nuclear gene data (pgiC and SQD1) using a Bayesian inference approach. The morphology of the group was studied and important features mapped onto the phylogeny. KEY RESULTS We present an overall well-supported phylogeny of Selaginella, and the phylogenetic positions of some previously problematic taxa (i.e., S. sinensis and allies) are now resolved with strong support. We show that even though the evolution of most morphological characters involves reversals and/or parallelisms, several characters are phylogenetically informative. Seven major clades are identified, which each can be uniquely diagnosed by a suite of morphological features. There is value in morphology after all! CONCLUSIONS Our hypothesis of the evolutionary relationships of Selaginella is well founded based on DNA sequence data, as well as morphology, and is in line with previous findings. It will serve as a firm basis for further studies on Selaginella with respect to, e.g., the poorly known alpha taxonomy, as well as evolutionary questions such as historical biogeographic reconstructions.},

We recently presented a phylogenetic analysis of Selaginellaceae based on DNA sequence data and, with the phylogeny as a framework, the study discussed the character evolution of the group focusing on gross morphology. Here we translate these findings into a new classification. METHODS To present a robust and useful classification, we identified well-supported monophyletic groups from our previous phylogenetic analysis of 223 species, which together represent the diversity of the family with respect to morphology, taxonomy, and geographical distribution. Care was taken to choose groups with supporting morphology. KEY RESULTS In this classification, we recognize a single genus Selaginella and seven subgenera: Selaginella, Rupestrae, Lepidophyllae, Gymnogynum, Exaltatae, Ericetorum, and Stachygynandrum. The subgenera are all well supported based on analysis of DNA sequence data and morphology. A key to the subgenera is presented. CONCLUSIONS Our new classification is based on a well-founded hypothesis of the evolutionary relationships of Selaginella, and each subgenus can be identified by a suite of morphological features, most of them possible to study in the field. Our intention is that the classification will be useful not only to experts in the field, but also to a broader audience.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Several members of Selaginella are renowned for their ability to survive extreme drought and "resurrect" when conditions improve. Many of these belong to subgenus Tetragonostachys, a group of ∼45 species primarily found in North and Central America, with substantial diversity in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. We evaluated the monophyly and the age of subgenus Tetragonostachys and assess how drought tolerance contributed to the evolution of this clade. METHODS Our study included most Tetragonostachys species, using plastid and nuclear sequences, fossil and herbarium records, and climate variables to describe the species diversity, phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and climatic niche evolution in the subgenus. KEY RESULTS We found that subgenus Tetragonostachys forms a monophyletic group sister to Selaginella lepidophylla and may have diverged from other Selaginella because of a Gondwanan-Laurasian vicariance event ca. 240 mya. The North American radiation of Tetragonostachys appears to be much more recent and to have occurred during the Early Cretaceous-late Paleocene interval. We identified two significant and nested ecological niche shifts during the evolution of Tetragonostachys associated with extreme drought tolerance and a more recent shift to cold climates. Our analyses suggest that drought tolerance evolved in the warm deserts of southwest North America and may have been advantageous for colonization of cold and dry boreal climates. CONCLUSIONS Our investigation provides a foundation for future research addressing the genomics of ecological niche evolution and the potential role of reticulate evolution in Selaginella subgenus Tetragonostachys.},

	abstract = {The flora of the Mediterranean region and Macaronesia is characterized by high levels of species diversity and endemism. We examined phylogenetic relationships of Scrophularia within one of its secondary centers of diversity located in the Iberian Peninsula and adjacent Macaronesia. In total, 65 ingroup accessions from 45 species, representing an almost complete sampling of the region, were analyzed using sequences from the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and the plastid trnQ-rps16 intergenic spacer. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and statistical parsimony networking. Incongruence between datasets was assessed with statistical tests and displayed by split networks. Biogeographic inferences incorporating information from both markers (despite low resolution in some parts of the trees) and all incongruent taxa were accomplished with a novel combination of methods, using trees generated with the taxon duplication approach as input for Bayesian binary MCMC (BBM) analysis as implemented in RASP. Nuclear and chloroplast markers support a clade which comprises the majority of Iberian and Macaronesian species and consists of three subclades. Analyses of the substantial incongruence observed among markers indicate reticulate evolution and suggest that Scrophularia species diversity in this region is largely attributable to hybridization; a combination of both polyploidy and dysploidy in the karyotypic evolution of Western Mediterranean Scrophularia taxa is proposed. Our results provide support for an ancient hybridization event between two widespread lineages, which resulted in an allopolyploid ancestor of the Iberian - Macaronesian group with 2n=58 chromosomes. The ancestor then diverged into the three main lineages present in the Iberian Peninsula, Northern Africa and Macaronesia today. Subsequent interspecific hybridizations at different ploidy levels additionally generated new species. Presumably, hybridization and diversification within the genus in the Western Mediterranean have not been restricted to one particular event, but occurred repeatedly. It can be assumed that the topographical complexity found in the Iberian Peninsula has promoted diversification and hybrid speciation processes in Scrophularia, and that isolation in glacial refugia has preserved recent and ancient lineages. For the Macaronesian taxa, biogeographic analyses support several origins, by colonizations from at least four distinct lineages.},

Phylogenetic relationships of 116 Scrophularia taxa were investigated based on two plastid (ndhF and trnL-trnF) and one nuclear (ITS) DNA regions. A wider time-calibrated analysis of ndhF sequences of the Lamiales revealed that Scrophularia diverged as early as in the Miocene ({\textless}22 Ma). Results of maximum-likelihood optimizations supported wasp pollination as the ancestral pollination system from which other systems derived (hoverfly, mixed vertebrate-insect and bird systems). Four origins for a mixed vertebrate-insect (MVI) pollination system were inferred, in which two western Mediterranean species (S. sambucifolia and S. grandiflora) and two island species (the Tirrenian S. trifoliata and the Canarian S. calliantha) were involved. S. calliantha is the only species in which a more complex MVI system, including pollination by the lizard Gallotia stehlini, has evolved. In addition, bird (hummingbird) floral traits found in the New Mexican S. macrantha appear to have been independently acquired. In contrast, we failed to find evidence for an ancient role of hummingbirds in the evolution of European Scrophularia. Indeed, paleontological data revealed that extinction of European hummingbirds (30-32 Ma) occurred earlier than the divergence of European MVI lineages of Scrophularia. In conclusion, our results showed that a role of birds in pollination of Scrophularia may not have been effective in the Miocene-Pliocene, but bird pollination that shows its origin in the Pliocene-Pleistocene is still operating independently in different islands and continents.},

	abstract = {The taxa of the Leucophyllum pringlei clade were used to understand the influence of the Neogene orogenesis and the Quaternary climate cycles on the diversification of the flora of the xeric regions of North America. This clade includes the five southernmost species of the genus: L. ambiguum, L. flyrii, L. pruinosum and L. ultramonticola, which are distributed throughout the Chihuahuan Desert north of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and L. pringlei in the region of Tehuacán-Cuicatlán south of this mountain range. Here we test whether these species diverged during the pluvial periods of the Pleistocene, and whether L. pringlei diverged earlier from the other species during the uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Using three plastid regions (psbA-trnH, psbK-psbI, trnL-F) and a nuclear (ITS) marker, phylogenetic analyses were carried out, along with a reconstruction of their ancestral area. Trees retrieved the five species in a monophyletic group with the most recent common ancestor distributed in the Sinaloan dry forest during the Late Miocene (8.08Ma), from where it dispersed to the Chihuahuan Desert during the Late Miocene (6.35Ma). The secondary uplift of the Sierra Madre Occidental during the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene influenced a vicariance event. Divergence between L. pringlei and the species from north of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt occurred during the second volcanic episode in the Late Miocene (7.5-3Ma). The most recent common ancestor of L. ambiguum, L. pruinosum and L. ultramonticola was widely distributed in the southern part of the Chihuahuan Desert during the Early to Late Pliocene (3.50Ma). The diversification of these three species occurred in the Middle Pleistocene (0.9Ma) during the pluvial and inter-pluvial cycles.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY We sought novel evolutionary insights for the highly diverse Saxifragales by constructing a large phylogenetic tree encompassing 36.8\% of the species-level biodiversity. • METHODS We built a phylogenetic tree for 909 species of Saxifragales and used this hypothesis to examine character evolution for annual or perennial habit, woody or herbaceous habit, ovary position, petal number, carpel number, and stamen to petal ratio. We employed likelihood approaches to investigate the effect of habit and life history on speciation and extinction within this clade. • KEY RESULTS Two major shifts occurred from a woody ancestor to the herbaceous habit, with multiple secondary changes from herbaceous to woody. Transitions among superior, subinferior, and inferior ovaries appear equiprobable. A major increase in petal number is correlated with a large increase in carpel number; these increases have co-occurred multiple times in Crassulaceae. Perennial or woody lineages have higher rates of speciation than annual or herbaceous ones, but higher probabilities of extinction offset these differences. Hence, net diversification rates are highest for annual, herbaceous lineages and lowest for woody perennials. The shift from annuality to perenniality in herbaceous taxa is frequent. Conversely, woody perennial lineages to woody annual transitions are infrequent; if they occur, the woody annual state is left immediately. • CONCLUSIONS The large tree provides new insights into character evolution that are not obvious with smaller trees. Our results indicate that in some cases the evolution of angiosperms might be conditioned by constraints that have been so far overlooked.},

	doi = {10.1080/10635150801888871},
	abstract = {Despite the prior use of approximately 9000 bp, deep-level relationships within the angiosperm clade, Saxifragales remain enigmatic, due to an ancient, rapid radiation (89.5 to 110 Ma based on the fossil record). To resolve these deep relationships, we constructed several new data sets: (1) 16 genes representing the three genomic compartments within plant cells (2 nuclear, 10 plastid, 4 mitochondrial; aligned, analyzed length = 21,460 bp) for 28 taxa; (2) the entire plastid inverted repeat (IR; 26,625 bp) for 17 taxa; (3) "total evidence" (50,845 bp) for both 17 and 28 taxa (the latter missing the IR). Bayesian and ML methods yielded identical topologies across partitions with most clades receiving high posterior probability (pp = 1.0) and bootstrap (95\% to 100\%) values, suggesting that with sufficient data, rapid radiations can be resolved. In contrast, parsimony analyses of different partitions yielded conflicting topologies, particularly with respect to the placement of Paeoniaceae, a clade characterized by a long branch. In agreement with published simulations, the addition of characters increased bootstrap support for the putatively erroneous placement of Paeoniaceae. Although having far fewer parsimony-informative sites, slowly evolving plastid genes provided higher resolution and support for deep-level relationships than rapidly evolving plastid genes, yielding a topology close to the Bayesian and ML total evidence tree. The plastid IR region may be an ideal source of slowly evolving genes for resolution of deep-level angiosperm divergences that date to 90 My or more. Rapidly evolving genes provided support for tip relationships not recovered with slowly evolving genes, indicating some complementarity. Age estimates using penalized likelihood with and without age constraints for the 28-taxon, total evidence data set are comparable to fossil dates, whereas estimates based on the 17-taxon data are much older than implied by the fossil record. Hence, sufficient taxon density, and not simply numerous base pairs, is important in reliably estimating ages. Age estimates indicate that the early diversification of Saxifragales occurred rapidly, over a time span as short as 6 million years. Between 25,000 and 50,000 bp were needed to resolve this radiation with high support values. Extrapolating from Saxifragales, a similar number of base pairs may be needed to resolve the many other deep-level radiations of comparable age in angiosperms.},

	abstract = {Saniculiphyllum, a monotypic genus distributed in Southwest China, was thought to be extinct before our recent rediscovery. The taxonomic position of this genus has been enigmatic ever since its publication. It was originally treated as the only member of a distinct tribe Saniculiphylleae in the family Saxifragaceae. Some proposed a new family, Saniculophyllaceae, to accommodate this genus, although its affinities are clearly with members of Saxifragaceae. Here we analyzed six DNA regions, the nuclear ribosomal ITS and 26S rDNA and the plastid rbcL, matK, trnL-trnF, psbA-trnH genes, spacers, and intron to explore the phylogenetic position of Saniculiphyllum within Saxifragaceae. The combined nuclear and chloroplast dataset includes 63 ingroup species, representing all genera but Hieronymusia in the family. Results from likelihood, parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic methods corroborate earlier results. Two clades of Saxifragaceae, the Heucheroid and Saxifragoid clades, were recovered. The topologies obtained from different analyses confirm the placement of Saniculiphyllum in Saxifragaceae, but our analyses reveal that Saniculiphyllum is embedded within the large Heucheroid clade. However, the closest relatives of Saniculiphyllum within the Heucheroid clade remain unclear. Combined with morphological data, our results suggest that Saniculiphyllum should best be regarded as a highly distinctive lineage within the Heucheroid clade of Saxifragaceae. Morphological novelties and conservation status of Saniculiphyllum are also presented.},

	abstract = {The widespread pattern of parallel flower evolution as an adaptation for particular pollinator agents, known as "pollination syndromes", has long drawn attention from evolutionary biologists. Here, we report parallel evolution of saucer-shaped flowers and an associated unusual pollination system within the lineage Heucherina, a group of saxifragaceous genera. Field observations reveal that 18 of 28 plant species studied are pollinated almost exclusively by fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae). Among the 18 species with a fungus-gnat pollination system, 13 have characteristic saucer-shaped flowers and are pollinated mainly by several unspecialized mycetophilid genera with short mouthparts. We performed phylogenetic analyses using nucleotide sequences of external and internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA and reconstructed ancestral floral morphologies with an establishment of the model of floral character evolution under a maximum-likelihood framework. Our analysis indicates that there is significant directionality in the evolutionary shifts of floral forms in the Heucherina. The inferred phylogeny further supports four origins of saucer-shaped flowers, which is shared among 14 species that are traditionally classified into the genus Mitella. In addition, our analysis indicates the extensive polyphyly of genus Mitella, as also suggested previously. The results suggest that the flower-visiting fungus gnats have caused convergent selection for the saucer-shaped flower repeatedly evolved within Heucherina.},

	abstract = {Saxifragaceae (Saxifragales) contain approximately 640 species and 33 genera, about half of which are monotypic. Due to factors such as morphological stasis, convergent morphological evolution, and disjunct distributions, relationships within Saxifragaceae have historically been troublesome. The family occurs primarily in mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the highest generic and species diversity in western North America, but disjunct taxa are known from southern South America. Here, we integrate broad gene (56 loci) and taxon (223 species) sampling strategies, both the most comprehensive to date within Saxifragaceae, with fossil calibrations and geographical distribution data to address relationships, divergence times, and historical biogeography among major lineages of Saxifragaceae. Two previously recognized main clades, the heucheroids (eight groups+Saniculiphyllum) and saxifragoids (Saxifraga s.s.), were re-affirmed by our phylogenetic analyses. Relationships among the eight heucheroid groups, as well as the phylogenetic position of Saniculiphyllum within the heucheroids, were resolved with mostly high support. Divergence time estimates indicate that Saxifragaceae began to diversify ca. 38.37 million years ago (Mya; 95\% HPD=30.99-46.11Mya) in the Mid-Late Eocene, and that the two major lineages, the heucheroids and saxifragoids, began to diversify approximately 30.04Mya (95\% HPD=23.87-37.15Mya) and 30.85 Mya (95\% HPD=23.47-39.33Mya), respectively. We reconstructed ancestral geographic areas using statistical dispersal-vicariance (S-DIVA). These analyses indicate several radiations within Saxifragaceae: one in eastern Asia and multiple radiations in western North America. Our results also demonstrate that large amounts of sequence data coupled with broad taxon sampling can help resolve clade relationships that have thus far seemed intractable.},

A single matR gene tree is generated from parsimony, distance, and likelihood analyses, respectively. The three trees with the same topology are slightly different in bootstrapping support for some clades. The result indicates that Saururaceae is monophyletic. Anemopsis is sister to Houttuynia, and the two genera form the first diverging lineage of the family. The sister group relationship between Saururus and Gymnotheca is also supported by a relatively high bootstrap value. The result is different from all the former phylogenetic opinions on Saururaceae based on morphology, but it is supported by the evolution of flower-bract stalk in Saururaceae. In addition, some characteristics of the matR gene are analyzed. The MatR gene is a relatively better tool to reconstruct the molecular clock because the base substitution bias greatly decreases in the gene.},

This recently radiated group is a promising system to examine the structural evolution and diversification of carnivorous plants; however, little is known regarding evolutionary relationships within the genus. Previous attempts at resolving the phylogeny have been unsuccessful, most likely due to few parsimony-informative sites compounded by incomplete lineage sorting. Here, we applied a target enrichment approach using multiple accessions to assess the relationships of Sarracenia species. This resulted in 199 nuclear genes from 75 accessions covering the putative 8-11 species and 8 subspecies/varieties. In addition, we recovered 42kb of plastome sequence from each accession to estimate a cpDNA-derived phylogeny. Unsurprisingly, the cpDNA had few parsimony-informative sites (0.5\%) and provided little information on species relationships. In contrast, use of the targeted nuclear loci in concatenation and coalescent frameworks elucidated many relationships within Sarracenia even with high heterogeneity among gene trees. Results were largely consistent for both concatenation and coalescent approaches. The only major disagreement was with the placement of the purpurea complex. Moreover, results suggest an Appalachian massif biogeographic origin of the genus. Overall, this study highlights the utility of target enrichment using multiple accessions to resolve relationships in recently radiated taxa.},

	abstract = {The carnivorous plant family Sarraceniaceae comprises three genera of wetland-inhabiting pitcher plants: Darlingtonia in the northwestern United States, Sarracenia in eastern North America, and Heliamphora in northern South America. Hypotheses concerning the biogeographic history leading to this unusual disjunct distribution are controversial, in part because genus- and species-level phylogenies have not been clearly resolved. Here, we present a robust, species-rich phylogeny of Sarraceniaceae based on seven mitochondrial, nuclear, and plastid loci, which we use to illuminate this family's phylogenetic and biogeographic history. The family and genera are monophyletic: Darlingtonia is sister to a clade consisting of Heliamphora+Sarracenia. Within Sarracenia, two clades were strongly supported: one consisting of S. purpurea, its subspecies, and S. rosea; the other consisting of nine species endemic to the southeastern United States. Divergence time estimates revealed that stem group Sarraceniaceae likely originated in South America 44-53 million years ago (Mya) (highest posterior density [HPD] estimate = 47 Mya). By 25-44 (HPD = 35) Mya, crown-group Sarraceniaceae appears to have been widespread across North and South America, and Darlingtonia (western North America) had diverged from Heliamphora+Sarracenia (eastern North America+South America). This disjunction and apparent range contraction is consistent with late Eocene cooling and aridification, which may have severed the continuity of Sarraceniaceae across much of North America. Sarracenia and Heliamphora subsequently diverged in the late Oligocene, 14-32 (HPD = 23) Mya, perhaps when direct overland continuity between North and South America became reduced. Initial diversification of South American Heliamphora began at least 8 Mya, but diversification of Sarracenia was more recent (2-7, HPD = 4 Mya); the bulk of southeastern United States Sarracenia originated co-incident with Pleistocene glaciation, {\textless}3 Mya. Overall, these results suggest climatic change at different temporal and spatial scales in part shaped the distribution and diversity of this carnivorous plant clade.},

	abstract = {Recent phylogenetic studies in Sapotaceae have demonstrated that many genera need to be redefined to better correspond to natural groups. The Neotropical genus Pradosia is believed to be monophyletic and includes 26 recognized species. Here we reconstruct the generic phylogeny by a species-tree approach using (∗)BEAST, 21 recognized species (36 accessions), sequence data from three nuclear markers (ITS, ETS, and RPB2), a relaxed lognormal clock model, and a fossil calibration. We explore the evolution of five selected morphological characters, reconstruct the evolution of habitat (white-sand vs. clayish soils) preference, as well as space and time by using a recently developed continuous diffusion model in biogeography. We find Pradosia to be monophyletic in its current circumscription and to have originated in the Amazon basin at ∼47.5Ma. Selected morphological characters are useful to readily distinguish three clades. Preferences to white-sand and/or clay are somewhat important for the majority of species, but speciation has not been powered by habitat shifts. Pradosia brevipes is a relative young species (∼1.3Ma) that has evolved a unique geoxylic life strategy within Pradosia and is restricted to savannahs. Molecular dating and phylogenetic pattern indicate that Pradosia reached the Brazilian Atlantic coast at least three times: at 34.4Ma (P. longipedicellata), at 11.7Ma (P. kuhlmannii), and at 3.9Ma (weakly supported node within the red-flowered clade).},

We analyzed nuclear (ETS, ITS) and chloroplast (trnH-psbA, trnS-G) sequence data, and 42 morphological characters, using a near-complete taxon sampling. The resulting phylogeny provides a new generic framework where Leptostylis and Sebertia are monophyletic, Niemeyera is recognized as a small genus confined to Australia, and the circumscriptions of Achradotypus and Pycnandra require significant modification. This framework allows about 20 recently discovered species to be described in appropriate genera and assessed for their conservation status. Evolutionary changes in two widely used characters, anisomerous flowers and the number of stamens inserted opposite each corolla lobe, have occurred multiple times. There is no evidence that anisomery originated through hybridization as suggested in other groups. Instead, the two characters are closely coupled and often mutually exclusive. The diagnostic value of morphological characters varies considerably; for example, the presence, absence, and type of malpighiaceous hairs convey more phylogenetic information than many traditionally used features. Criteria and options for a new generic classification are discussed, and a reconstruction of the hypothesized ancestor that likely colonized New Caledonia in the Oligocene is presented.},

	abstract = {We used Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of 5 kb of chloroplast DNA data from 68 Sapotaceae species to clarify phylogenetic relationships within Sapotoideae, one of the two major clades within Sapotaceae. Variation in substitution rates through time was shown to be a very important aspect of molecular evolution for this data set. Relative rates tests indicated that changes in overall rate have taken place in several lineages during the history of the group and Bayes factors strongly supported a covarion model, which allows the rate of a site to vary over time, over commonly used models that only allow rates to vary across sites. Rate variation over time was actually found to be a more important model component than rate variation across sites. The covarion model was originally developed for coding gene sequences and has so far only been tested for this type of data. The fact that it performed so well with the present data set, consisting mainly of data from noncoding spacer regions, suggests that it deserves a wider consideration in model based phylogenetic inference. Repeatability of phylogenetic results was very difficult to obtain with the more parameter rich models, and analyses with identical settings often supported different topologies. Overparameterization may be the reason why the MCMC did not sample from the posterior distribution in these cases. The problem could, however, be overcome by using less parameter rich evolutionary models, and adjusting the MCMC settings. The phylogenetic results showed that two taxa, previously thought to belong in Sapotoideae, are not part of this group. Eberhardtia aurata is the sister of the two major Sapotaceae clades, Chrysophylloideae and Sapotoideae, and Neohemsleya usambarensis belongs in Chrysophylloideae. Within Sapotoideae two clades, Sideroxyleae and Sapoteae, were strongly supported. Bayesian analysis of the character history of some floral morphological traits showed that the ancestral type of flower in Sapotoideae may have been characterized by floral parts (sepals, petals, stamens, and staminodes) in single whorls of five, entire corolla lobes, and seeds with an adaxial hilum.},

Incongruence between the two data sets was examined with a nuclear low copy gene phylogeny to discover any occurrences of reticulate evolution. The Pacific clade Nesoluma was shown to have two distinct copies of the nuclear low copy gene AAT, one from an African and one from an American ancestral lineage, indicating that it is of allopolyploid origin. We conclude that Sideroxyleae, including the ancestral lineages of Nesoluma, were part of the boreotropical flora and entered the New World via the north Atlantic land bridge. We also suggest that the distribution of extant species resulted from the cooling climate at the end of the Eocene.

In contrast, all species currently assigned to these and other segregate genera confined to Australia, New Caledonia, or neighboring islands, form a supported clade. Earlier classifications in which more genera are recognized may better reflect relationships among New Caledonian taxa. Hence, there is need for a revision of generic boundaries in Chrysophylleae, and particularly within the Pouteria complex, including Leptostylis, Niemeyera, Pichonia, Pouteria pro parte (the main part of section Oligotheca), and Pycnandra. Section Oligotheca have been recognized as the separate genus Planchonella, a monophyletic group that needs to be resurrected. Three clades with strong support in our jackknife analysis have one Australian species that is sister to a relatively large group of New Caledonian endemics, suggesting multiple dispersal events between this small and isolated tropical island and Australia.

Cardiospermum shows the most variable chromosome number of the tribe. Phylogenetic relationships within the genus Cardiospermum, especially with other species of the tribe, are poorly understood. This research focuses on characterisation of the karyotypic features of Cardiospermum using conventional cytogenetic methods, CMA/DAPI chromosome banding and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). To elucidate the phylogeny of the genus, the nuclear markers ITS1 and ITS2 were sequenced and analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Cardiospermum shows important diversity in basic numbers, with x = 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12. All species studied have metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes, some species have subtelocentric chromosomes, while telocentric chromosomes are absent. The interphase nuclei differentiate the Cardiospermum species into two groups. The CMA(3) /DAPI chromosome banding revealed the presence of an AT-rich terminal region in C. corindum, C. grandiflorum and C. urvilleoides, whereas GC-rich regions were found in C. grandiflorum, C. halicacabum var. halicacabum, C. halicacabum var. microcarpum, C. heringeri and C. integerrimum. FISH revealed syntenic and non-syntenic distribution of the 18-5.8-26S and 5S rDNA. The syntenic distribution always occurred in the short arms of the same chromosome in all of the species. The phylogenetic relationships reveal, in part, the taxonomic arrangement of the genus Cardiospermum.},

	abstract = {Simulations suggest that molecular clock analyses can correctly identify the root of a tree even when the clock assumption is severely violated. Clock-based rooting of phylogenies may be particularly useful when outgroup rooting is problematic. Here, we explore relaxed-clock rooting in the Acer/Dipteronia clade of Sapindaceae, which comprises genera of highly uneven species richness and problematic mutual monophyly. Using an approach that does not presuppose rate autocorrelation between ancestral and descendant branches and hence does not require a rooted a priori topology, we analyzed data from up to seven chloroplast loci for some 50 ingroup species. For comparison, we used midpoint and outgroup rooting and dating methods that rely on rooted input trees, namely penalized likelihood, a Bayesian autocorrelated-rates model, and a strict clock. The chloroplast sequences used here reject a single global substitution rate, and the assumption of autocorrelated rates was also rejected. The root was placed between Acer and Dipteronia by all three rooting methods, albeit with low statistical support. Analyses of Acer diversification with a lineage-through-time plot and different survival models, although sensitive to missing data, suggest a gradual decrease in the average diversification rate. The nine North American species of Acer diverged from their nearest relatives at widely different times: eastern American Acer diverged in the Oligocene and Late Miocene; western American species in the Late Eocene and Mid Miocene; and the Acer core clade, including A. saccharum, dates to the Miocene. Recent diversification in North America is strikingly rare compared to diversification in eastern Asia.},

Here, we tested the hypothesis that Aesculus and Billia are mutually monophyletic using phylogenetic analyses of seven molecular markers and 31 accessions of Hippocastaneae representing 14 species. We performed phylogenetic analyses using a dataset of concatenated genes as well as with coalescent method for constructing a species tree from individual gene trees. The analysis of seven concatenated markers and the species tree strongly supported the mutual monophyly of Aesculus and Billia. We also recovered support for the traditional arrangement of genera within Hippocastaneae: Aesculus and Billia comprising a clade that is sister to Handeliodendron.

Secondly, the alignment was analyzed using RNA specific models of sequence evolution that account for the variation in nucleotide evolution in the independent loops and covariating stems regions of the ribosomal spacers. These models and phylogeny drawn from these analyzes were compared with that from analyzes using 'traditional' 4-state models and previous plastid analyzes. These analyzes identified that paired-site models developed to deal specifically with stem structures in RNA encoding sequences more appropriately account for the evolutionary history of the sequences than traditional 4-state substitution models.},

Both matK and rps16 intron provide few informative characters within Alectryon, whereas ITS-1 provides the largest number of parsimony-informative characters and has the greatest sequence divergence between taxa. Support for branches in cladograms produced in PAUP increased markedly upon inclusion of ITS-1 data to matK and rps16 intron data. Analyses of each region alone or combined produced congruent results, suggesting that the regions are complementary. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are two main lineages within Alectryon, with A. subcinereus sister to the remaining sampled Alectryon taxa. Two morphological characters, presence/absence of petals and aril patterning, are congruent with the molecular phylogeny. One robustly supported clade is characterized by smooth arils and petals, in contrast to the taxa in the other major clade which have patterned arils and an absence of petals. These analyses also support a number of revised subgeneric groupings for Alectryon. The decision to submerge Heterodendrum in Alectryon is supported, although taxa belonging to Heterodendrum do not form a clade. The majority of the Australian Alectryon appear to belong to the tropical monsoonal/arid flora with species from both lineages being found in representative vine thickets across northern Australia. It appears that the seasonally dry rainforest communities comprise a number of elements that do not share common evolutionary histories within this genus.},

Additional phylogenetic analyses conducted here (including material of Haplocoelum inopleum Radlk., the generic type) supported the result from the previous analysis and showed that maintaining a broad circumscription of Haplocoelum to include the Malagasy species would render the genus polyphyletic. To maintain monophyly, it is necessary to exclude H. perrieri, which we transfer to a new, monotypic genus, described here as Gereaua. This taxon is easily distinguished from the species retained in Haplocoelum by the following morphological characters: (1) sexually dimorphic inflorescences in racemules (vs. monomorphic inflorescences in fascicule of cymes); (2) 2-locular ovary (vs. 3-locular ovary); (3) rudimentary pistillode in staminate flowers (vs. no pistillode in staminate flowers); (4) corolla with 4 or 5 petals (vs. apetalous); (5) pubescent fruit (vs. glabrous fruit). Relationships between the new genus and its most closely related genera, included in the Macphersonia group, are discussed in light of molecular, morphological and biogeographic evidence.

	doi = {10.1093/sysbio/syq057},
	abstract = {For the last 2 decades, supertree reconstruction has been an active field of research and has seen the development of a large number of major algorithms. Because of the growing popularity of the supertree methods, it has become necessary to evaluate the performance of these algorithms to determine which are the best options (especially with regard to the supermatrix approach that is widely used). In this study, seven of the most commonly used supertree methods are investigated by using a large empirical data set (in terms of number of taxa and molecular markers) from the worldwide flowering plant family Sapindaceae. Supertree methods were evaluated using several criteria: similarity of the supertrees with the input trees, similarity between the supertrees and the total evidence tree, level of resolution of the supertree and computational time required by the algorithm. Additional analyses were also conducted on a reduced data set to test if the performance levels were affected by the heuristic searches rather than the algorithms themselves. Based on our results, two main groups of supertree methods were identified: on one hand, the matrix representation with parsimony (MRP), MinFlip, and MinCut methods performed well according to our criteria, whereas the average consensus, split fit, and most similar supertree methods showed a poorer performance or at least did not behave the same way as the total evidence tree. Results for the super distance matrix, that is, the most recent approach tested here, were promising with at least one derived method performing as well as MRP, MinFlip, and MinCut. The output of each method was only slightly improved when applied to the reduced data set, suggesting a correct behavior of the heuristic searches and a relatively low sensitivity of the algorithms to data set sizes and missing data. Results also showed that the MRP analyses could reach a high level of quality even when using a simple heuristic search strategy, with the exception of MRP with Purvis coding scheme and reversible parsimony. The future of supertrees lies in the implementation of a standardized heuristic search for all methods and the increase in computing power to handle large data sets. The latter would prove to be particularly useful for promising approaches such as the maximum quartet fit method that yet requires substantial computing power.},

DNA sequences from nuclear SSU and LSU rDNA, and chloroplast rbcL, matK and trnL-F from 39 santalalean taxa were obtained. Separate and combined data partitions were analyzed with maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Time estimates were performed with Bayesian relaxed molecular clock and penalized likelihood methods using published fossil data. Both methods gave comparable divergence dates for the major clades. These data confirm five origins of aerial parasitism, first in Misodendraceae ca. 80 Mya and subsequently in Viscaceae (72 Mya), "Eremolepidaceae" (53 Mya), tribe Amphorogyneae in Santalaceae (46 Mya), and Loranthaceae (28 Mya). The rapid adaptive radiation and speciation in Loranthaceae coincides with the appearance of savanna biomes during the Oligocene. In all clades except Misodendraceae, it appears that aerial parasites evolved from ancestors that were polymorphic for either root or stem parasitism-a condition here termed amphiphagous. Convergences in morphological features associated with the mistletoe habit have occurred such as the squamate habit, seed attachment structures, unisexual flowers, and loss of chlorophyll.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The taxonomy and systematics of Salix subgenus Salix s.l. is difficult. The reliability and evolutionary implications of two important morphological characters (number of stamens, and morphology of bud scales) used in subgeneric classification within Salix remain untested, and a disjunct Old-New World distribution pattern of a main clade of subgenus Salix s.l., revealed by a previous study, lacks a reasonable explanation. To study these questions, we conducted phylogenetic analyses based on 4,688 bp of sequence data from four plastid (rbcL, trnD-T, matK, and atpB-rbcL) and two nuclear markers (ETS and ITS) covering all subgenera of Salix, and all sections of subgenus Salix s.l. RESULTS Subgenus Salix came out as para- or polyphyletic in both nrDNA and plastid trees. The plastid phylogeny successfully resolved relationships among the major clades of Salix, but resolution within subgenus Salix s.l. remained low. Nevertheless, three monophyletic groups were identifiable in subgenus Salix s.l.: the 'main clade' of subgenus Salix s.l., with New and Old World species being reciprocally monophyletic; the section Triandroides clade; and the subgenus Pleuradenia clade. While nrDNA regions showed higher resolution within subgenus Salix s.l., they failed to resolve subgeneric relationships. Extensive, statistically significant gene-tree incongruence was detected across nrDNA-plastid as well as nrDNA ETS-ITS phylogenies, suggesting reticulate evolution or hybridization within the group. The results were supported by network analyses. Ancestral-state reconstructions indicated that multiple stamens and free bud scales represent the plesiomorphic states within Salix, and that several significant shifts in stamen number and bud scale morphology have occurred. CONCLUSIONS Subgenus Salix s.l. is not monophyletic, and the evolutionary history of the subgenus has involved multiple reticulation events that may mainly be due to hybridization. The delimitation of subgenus Salix s.l. should be redefined by excluding section Triandrae and subgenus Pleuradenia from it. The evolutionary lability of bud-scale morphology and stamen number means that these characters are unreliable bases for classification. The disjunct Old-New World distribution of subgenus Salix s.l. appears to be linked to the profound climatic cooling during the Tertiary, which cut off gene exchange between New and Old World lineages.},

The resulting phylogenetic trees showed better resolution at both inter- and intra-sectional level than previous studies. The results revealed that (1) the plastid-based phylogenetic tree resulted in two main clades, suggesting an early divergence of the maternal progenitors of Populus; (2) three advanced sections (Populus, Aigeiros and Tacamahaca) are of hybrid origin; (3) species of the section Tacamahaca could be divided into two major groups based on plastid and nuclear DNA data, suggesting a polyphyletic nature of the section; and (4) many species proved to be of hybrid origin based on the incongruence between plastid and nuclear DNA trees.

We combined genetic and ecogeographic data from 2 closely related North American tree species, Populus balsamifera and P. trichocarpa (Salicacaeae), to determine if their divergence coincided with and was possibly caused by Pleistocene climatic events. We analyzed 32 nuclear loci from individuals of P. balsamifera and P. trichocarpa to produce coalescent-based estimates of the divergence time between the 2 species. We coupled the coalescent analyses with paleodistribution models to assess the influence of climate change on species' range. Furthermore, measures of niche overlap were used to investigate patterns of ecological differentiation between species. We estimated the divergence date of P. balsamifera and P. trichocarpa at approximately 75 Ka, which corresponds closely with the onset of Marine Isotope Stage 4 (∼76 Ka) and a rapid increase in global ice volume. Significance tests of niche overlap, in conjunction with genetic estimates of migration, suggested that speciation occurred in allopatry, possibly resulting from the environmental effects of Pleistocene glacial cycles. Our results indicate that the divergence of keystone tree species, which have shaped community diversity in northern North American ecosystems, was recent and may have been a consequence of Pleistocene-era glaciation and climate change.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Evolution of synonymous codon usage is thought to be determined by a balance between mutation, genetic drift and natural selection on translational efficiency. However, natural selection on codon usage is considered to be a weak evolutionary force and selection on codon usage is expected to be strongest in species with large effective population sizes. RESULTS I examined the evolution of synonymous codons using EST data from five species of Populus. Data on relative synonymous codon usage in genes with high and low gene expression were used to identify 25 codons from 18 different amino acids that were deemed to be preferred codons across all five species. All five species show significant correlations between codon bias and gene expression, independent of base composition, thus indicating that translational selection has shaped synonymous codon usage. Using a set of 158 orthologous genes I detected an excess of unpreferred to preferred (U --{\textgreater} P) mutations in two lineages, P. tremula and P. deltoides. Maximum likelihood estimates of the strength of selection acting on synonymous codons was also significantly greater than zero in P. tremula, with the ML estimate of 4Nes = 0.720. CONCLUSION The data is consistent with weak selection on preferred codons in all five species. There is also evidence suggesting that selection on synonymous codons has increased in P. tremula. Although the reasons for the increase in selection on codon usage in the P. tremula lineage are not clear, one possible explanation is an increase in the effective population size in P. tremula.},

	abstract = {As molecular phylogenetic analyses incorporate ever-greater numbers of loci, cases of cytonuclear discordance - the phenomenon in which nuclear gene trees deviate significantly from organellar gene trees - are being reported more frequently. Plant examples of topological discordance, caused by recent hybridization between extant species, are well known. However, examples of branch-length discordance are less reported in plants relative to animals. We use a combination of de novo assembly and reference-based mapping using short-read shotgun sequences to construct a robust phylogeny of the plastome for multiple individuals of all the common Populus species in North America. We demonstrate a case of strikingly high plastome divergence, in contrast to little nuclear genome divergence, in two closely related balsam poplars, Populus balsamifera and Populus trichocarpa (Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa). Previous studies with nuclear loci indicate that the two species (or subspecies) diverged since the late Pleistocene, whereas their plastomes indicate deep divergence, dating to at least the Pliocene (6-7 Myr ago). Our finding is in marked contrast to the estimated Pleistocene divergence of the nuclear genomes, previously calculated at 75 000 yr ago, suggesting plastid capture from a 'ghost lineage' of a now-extinct North American poplar.},

The extensive interspecific hybridization and high morphological diversity in this group pose difficulties in identifying taxonomic units for comparative evolutionary studies and systematics. To understand the evolutionary relationships among poplars and to provide a framework for biosystematic classification, we reconstructed a phylogeny of the genus Populus based on nucleotide sequences of three noncoding regions of the chloroplast DNA (intron of trnL and intergenic regions of trnT-trnL and trnL-trnF) and ITS1 and ITS2 of the nuclear rDNA. The resulting phylogenetic trees showed polyphyletic relationships among species in the sections Tacamahaca and Aigeiros. Based on chloroplast DNA sequence data, P. nigra had a close affinity to species of section Populus, whereas nuclear DNA sequence data suggested a close relationship between P. nigra and species of the section Aigeiros, suggesting a possible hybrid origin for P. nigra. Similarly, the chloroplast DNA sequences of P. tristis and P. szechuanica were similar to that of the species of section Aigeiros, while the nuclear sequences revealed a close affinity to species of the section Tacamahaca, suggesting a hybrid origin for these two Asiatic balsam poplars.

	abstract = {Sabiaceae comprises three genera and ca. 80 species with an amphi-Pacific tropical disjunct distribution. It has been unclear whether the family is monophyletic, where the family belongs within the angiosperm phylogeny, and when and how is present-day disjunct distribution originated. To address these questions, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of Sabiaceae with comprehensive sampling of the family and basal eudicots using six chloroplast DNA loci (atpB, rbcL, matK, ndhF, atpB-rbcL and trnL-trnF). Our results support the monophyly of Sabiaceae s. l. that includes three genera: Meliosma Blume, Ophiocaryon Endl. and Sabia Colebr. The placement of Sabiaceae as sister to Proteales receives moderate bootstrap support, and is corroborated by various alternative hypothesis tests. Within Sabiaceae, Ophiocaryon and Sabia were resolved as strongly supported clades, whereas Meliosma was paraphyletic with Ophiocaryon nested within it. The biogeographically disjunct accessions of Meliosma alba (which is alternatively known as Kingsboroughia alba (Schltdl.) Liebm.) sampled from southwestern China and Mexico form a monophyletic group. Molecular dating and ancestral area reconstruction suggest a Eurasian origin of Sabiaceae in the late Cretaceous and a boreotropical range expansion during Paleogene. Southward migrations were inferred from continental Eurasia to the Malesian region in Sabia and in the Asian Meliosma, and from Central America to South America in the Neotropical clade of Meliosma in response to climatic cooling after the late Miocene. A long distance dispersal from Central America to tropical Asia was suggested during the time at the Neogene and Quaternary boundary in Meliosma alba (now recognized as Kingsboroughia alba). Our results also support the recognition of Kingsboroughia Liebm. as a distinct genus to maintain the monophyly of each of the genera: Meliosma, Ophiocaryon and Sabia. Kingsboroughia along with Meliosma and Ophiocaryon constitutes the subfamily Meliosmoideae Mast., while Sabia is the sole genus of Sabioideae Y.W. Law \& Y.F. Wu.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The succulent biome is highly fragmented throughout the Old and New World. The resulting disjunctions on global and regional scales have been explained by various hypotheses. To evaluate these, we used Thamnosma, which is restricted to the succulent biome and has trans-Atlantic and trans-African disjunctions. Its three main distribution centers are in southern North America, southern and eastern Africa including Socotra. METHODS We conducted parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses based on chloroplast and nuclear sequence data. We applied molecular clock calculations using the programs BEAST and MULTIDIVTIME and biogeographic reconstructions using S-DIVA and Lagrange. KEY RESULTS Our data indicate a weakly supported paraphyly of the New World species with respect to a palaeotropical lineage, which is further subdivided into a southern African and a Horn of Africa group. The disjunctions in Thamnosma are mostly dated to the Miocene. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the Old-New World disjunction of Thamnosma is likely the result of long-distance dispersal. The Miocene closure of the arid corridor between southern and eastern Africa may have caused the split within the Old World lineage, thus making a vicariance explanation feasible. The colonization of Socotra is also due to long-distance dispersal. All recent Thamnosma species are part of the succulent biome, and the North American species may have been members of the arid Neogene Madro-Tertiary Geoflora. Phylogenetic niche conservatism, rare long-distance dispersal, and local differentiation account for the diversity among species of Thamnosma.},

	abstract = {The Clauseneae (Aurantioideae, Rutaceae) is a tribe in the Citrus family that, although economically important as it contains the culinary and medicinally-useful curry tree (Bergera koenigii), has been relatively understudied. Due to the recent significant taxonomic changes made to this tribe, a closer inspection of the genetic relationships among its genera has been warranted. Whole genome skimming was used to generate chloroplast genomes from six species, representing each of the four genera (Bergera, Clausena, Glycosmis, Micromelum) in the Clauseneae tribe plus one closely related outgroup (Merrillia), using the published plastome sequence of Citrus sinensis as a reference. Phylogenetically informative character (PIC) data were analyzed using a genome alignment of the seven species, and variability frequency among the species was recorded for each coding and non-coding region, with the regions of highest variability identified for future phylogenetic studies. Non-coding regions exhibited a higher percentage of variable characters as expected, and the phylogenetic markers ycf1, matK, rpoC2, ndhF, trnS-trnG spacer, and trnH-psbA spacer proved to be among the most variable regions. Other markers that are frequently used in phylogenetic studies, e.g. rps16, atpB-rbcL, rps4-trnT, and trnL-trnF, proved to be far less variable. Phylogenetic analyses of the aligned sequences were conducted using Bayesian inference (MrBayes) and Maximum Likelihood (RAxML), yielding highly supported divisions among the four genera.},

	abstract = {Understanding the origin of island endemics is a central task of historical biogeography. Recent methodological advances provide a rigorous framework to determine the relative contribution of different biogeographic processes (e.g., vicariance, land migration, long-distance dispersal) to the origin of island endemics. With its complex but well-known history of microplate movements and climatic oscillations, the Mediterranean region (including the Mediterranean basin and Macaronesia) provides the geographic backdrop for the diversification of Ruta L., the type genus of Rutaceae (citrus family). Phylogenetic, molecular dating, and ancestral range reconstruction analyses were carried out to investigate the extent to which past geological connections and climatic history of the Mediterranean region explain the current distribution of species in Ruta, with emphasis on its island endemics. The analyses showed that Ruta invaded the region from the north well before the onset of the Mediterranean climate and diversified in situ as the climate became Mediterranean. The continental fragment island endemics of the genus originated via processes of land migration/vicariance driven by connections/disconnections between microplates, whereas the oceanic island endemics were the product of a single colonization event from the mainland followed by in situ diversification. This study emphasizes the need for an integrative, hypothesis-based approach to historical biogeography and stresses the importance of temporary land connections and colonization opportunity in the biotic assembly of continental fragment and oceanic islands, respectively.},

Trees derived from morphological, phytochemical, and molecular datasets of Ruteae were then compared to look for possible patterns of agreement among them. Furthermore, non-molecular characters were mapped on the molecular phylogeny to identify uniquely derived states and patterns of homoplasy in the morphological and phytochemical datasets. The phylogenetic analyses determined that Haplophyllum and Ruta form reciprocally exclusive monophyletic groups and that Dictamnus is not closely related to the other genera of Ruteae. The different types of datasets were partly incongruent with each other. The discordant phylogenetic patterns between the phytochemical and molecular trees might be best explained in terms of convergence in secondary chemical compounds. Finally, only a few non-molecular synapomorphies provided support for the clades of the molecular tree, while most of the morphological characters traditionally used for taxonomic purposes were found to be homoplasious. Within the context of the phylogenetic relationships supported by molecular data, Ruta, the type genus for the family, can only be diagnosed by using a combination of plesiomorphic, homoplasious, and autapomorphic morphological character states.},

The Malagasy Cedrelopsis has traditionally been associated with different families of the order Sapindales and its phylogenetic placement in Rutaceae sensu lato has yet to be tested with molecular data. The present molecular phylogenetic study reaffirms the monophyly of Ptaeroxylaceae and its placement in Spathelioideae. Therefore, molecules and morphology support close affinities between Bottegoa, Cedrelopsis, and Ptaeroxylon and also their current generic circumscriptions. We report a case of an evolutionary change from one-seeded to two-seeded carpels within the Harrisonia-Cneorum-Ptaeroxylaceae clade of Spathelioideae.

To assist with the much-needed suprageneric reclassification and with studies of evolution of chemical compounds and biogeographic history of the family, here we included sequence data (from two noncoding regions of the chloroplast genome-rps16 intron and trnL-trnF region) from 65 species in 59 genera (more than one third of those in the family) that represented all subfamilies and tribes and more genera of Toddalioideae and of neotropical groups than previous studies. Results confirmed that Cneorum, Ptaeroxylon, Spathelia, and Dictyoloma form a clade sister to the remaining Rutaceae, none of the subfamilies with more than one genus (except Aurantioideae) is monophyletic, and characters of the ovary and fruit are not reliable for circumscription of subfamilies. Furthermore, clades are better correlated with geographic distributions of the genera than with ovary and fruit characters. Circumscriptions of subfamilies and tribes (and some subtribes of Rutoideae) must be reevaluated.

One of its genera is Almeidea, whose species are morphologically similar to those of the genus Conchocarpus. Species of Almeidea occur in the Atlantic Rain Forest of Eastern Brazil, with one species (Almeidea rubra) also present in Bolivia. The objective of this study was to perform a phylogenetic analysis of Almeidea, using a broader sampling of Galipeinae and other Neotropical Rutaceae, the first such study focused on this subtribe. To achieve this objective, morphological data and molecular data from the nuclear markers ITS-1 and ITS-2 and the plastid markers trnL-trnF and rps16 were obtained. Representatives of eight genera of Galipeinae and three genera of Pilocarpinae (included also in Galipeeae) and Hortia (closely related to Galipeeae) were used. Five species of Almeidea and seven of Conchocarpus were included, given the morphological proximity between these two genera. Individual (for each molecular marker) and combined phylogenetic analyses were made, using parsimony and Bayesian inference as optimization criteria. Results showed Galipeinae as monophyletic, with the species of Almeidea also monophyletic (supported by the presence of pantocolporate pollen) and nested in a clade with a group of species of Conchocarpus, a non-monophyletic group. Additionally, C. concinnus appeared in a group with Andreadoxa, Erythrochiton, and Neoraputia, other members of Galipeinae. As a result, Conchocarpus would be monophyletic only with the exclusion of a group of species related to C. concinnus and with the inclusion of all species of Almeidea with the group of species of Conchocarpus that includes its type species, C. macrophyllus. Thus, species of Almeidea are transferred to Conchocarpus, and the new combinations are made here.},

The recent history of the systematics of Citrus (Rutaceae: Aurantioideae) and its allies, in the context of Rutaceae taxonomy as a whole, is reviewed. The most recent classification is tested using nine cpDNA sequence regions in representatives of all genera of the subfam. Aurantioideae (save Limnocitrus) and numerous species and hybrids referred to Citrus s.l. Aurantioideae are confirmed as monophyletic. Within Aurantioideae, tribe Clauseneae are not monophyletic unless Murraya s.s. and Merrillia are removed to Aurantieae. Within tribe Aurantieae, the three traditionally recognized subtribes are not monophyletic. Triphasiinae is not monophyletic unless Oxanthera is returned to Citrus (Citrinae). Balsamocitrinae is polyphyletic. Feroniella, traditionally considered allied closely to Limonia (=Feronia), is shown to be nested in Citrus. The proposed congenericity of Severinia and Atalantia is confirmed. The most recent circumscription of Citrus is strongly supported by this analysis, with hybrids appearing with their putative maternal parents. The genus was resolved into two clades, one comprising wild species from New Guinea, Australia, and New Caledonia (formerly Clymenia, Eremocitrus, Microcitrus, Oxanthera), but surprisingly also Citrus medica, traditionally believed to be native in India. The second clade is largely from the Asian mainland (including species formerly referred to Fortunella and Poncirus).},

The phylogenetic analysis sampled about 50\% of the 235 accepted species of Melicope as well as representatives of 26 related genera, most notably Acronychia and Euodia. The results based on five plastid and nuclear markers have revealed that Acronychia, Euodia and Melicope are each not monophyletic in their current circumscriptions and that several small genera mainly from Australia and New Caledonia need to be merged with one of the three genera to ensure monophyly at the generic level. The phylogenetic position of the drupaceous Acronychia in relation to Melicope, which has capsular or follicular fruits, remains unclear and Acronychia might be a separate genus or a part of Melicope. The seed coats of Melicope, Acronychia and related genera show adaptations to bird-dispersal, which might be regarded as key innovations for species radiations. Euodia and its relatives, which lack these adaptations, include only about 20 species while the Melicope-Acronychia group consists of about 340 species. The drupaceous genera Comptonella, Dutaillyea, Picrella and Sarcomelicope are nested within Melicope and need to be merged with Melicope.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The Spathelia-Ptaeroxylon clade is a group of morphologically diverse plants that have been classified together as a result of molecular phylogenetic studies. The clade is currently included in Rutaceae and recognized at a subfamilial level (Spathelioideae) despite the fact that most of its genera have traditionally been associated with other families and that there are no obvious morphological synapomorphies for the clade. The aim of the present study is to construct phylogenetic trees for the Spathelia-Ptaeroxylon clade and to investigate anatomical characters in order to decide whether it should be kept in Rutaceae or recognized at the familial level. Anatomical characters were plotted on a cladogram to help explain character evolution within the group. Moreover, phylogenetic relationships and generic limits within the clade are also addressed. METHODS A species-level phylogenetic analysis of the Spathelia-Ptaeroxylon clade based on five plastid DNA regions (rbcL, atpB, trnL-trnF, rps16 and psbA-trnH) was conducted using Bayesian, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. Leaf and seed anatomical characters of all genera were (re)investigated by light and scanning electron microscopy. KEY RESULTS With the exception of Spathelia, all genera of the Spathelila-Ptaeroxylon clade are monophyletic. The typical leaf and seed anatomical characters of Rutaceae were found. Further, the presence of oil cells in the leaves provides a possible synapomorphy for the clade. CONCLUSIONS The Spathelia-Ptaeroxylon clade is well placed in Rutaceae and it is reasonable to unite the genera into one subfamily (Spathelioideae). We propose a new tribal classification of Spathelioideae. A narrow circumscription of Spathelia is established to make the genus monophyletic, and Sohnreyia is resurrected to accommodate the South American species of Spathelia. The most recent common ancestor of Spathelioideae probably had leaves with secretory cavities and oil cells, haplostemonous flowers with appendaged staminal filaments, and a tracheidal tegmen.},

We present the first detailed phylogenetic and biogeographic study of the genus and its close relatives in the proto-Rutaceae group. Our phylogenetic analyses based on two plastid and two nuclear markers show that the genus Toddalia Juss. is nested within Zanthoxylum, that earlier generic and intrageneric classifications need revision, and that the homochlamydeous flowers of the temperate species of Zanthoxylum are the result of a reduction from heterochlamydeous flowers. The biogeographic analyses reveal a Eurasian origin of Zanthoxylum in the Paleocene or Eocene with successive intercontinental or long-range migrations. Zanthoxylum likely crossed the North Atlantic Land Bridges to colonize the Americas in the Eocene, and migrated back to the Old World probably via the Bering Land Bridge in the Oligocene or Miocene. Zanthoxylum also colonized several Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian clade shows phylogenetic incongruence between the plastid and nuclear datasets, suggesting hybridization. The Hawaiian species are one of the rare examples of endemic Hawaiian lineages that are older than the current main islands.},

Phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of Maianthemum with Maianthemum sensu stricto nested within Smilacina. Almost all species from the eastern Himalayan region in SW China except for Maianthemum tatsienense and M. stenolobum form a well supported clade. This clade is characterized morphologically by short filaments and large anthers, relatively large flowers, and pubescent stems and leaves. Maianthemum tatsienense and M. stenolobum from SW to central China form another clade. The other species from eastern Asia (central to NE China and Japan) and the New World fall into several clades. The intercontinental disjunction between eastern Asia and North America in Maianthemum sensu stricto is estimated to be at 1.68 million years ago (mya) with the Bayesian relaxed clock relying on uncorrelated rates. A recent radiation at about 2.04mya is suggested in the high mountains of SW China, corresponding to the geographical heterogeneity in that region after the uplift of the Himalayas. Long distance dispersal by birds may have facilitated the evolution of their intercontinental disjunction and their biogeographic diversifications in SW China.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous phylogenetics studies of Asparagales, although extensive and generally well supported, have left several sets of taxa unclearly placed and have not addressed all relationships within certain clades thoroughly (some clades were relatively sparsely sampled). One of the most important of these is sampling within and placement of Nolinoideae (Ruscaceae s.l.) of Asparagaceae sensu Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) III, which subfamily includes taxa previously referred to Convallariaceae, Dracaenaaceae, Eriospermaceae, Nolinaceae and Ruscaceae. METHODS A phylogenetic analysis of a combined data set for 126 taxa of Ruscaceae s.l. and related groups in Asparagales based on three nuclear and plastid DNA coding genes, 18S rDNA (1796 bp), rbcL (1338 bp) and matK (1668 bp), representing a total of approx. 4·8 kb is presented. Parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses were conducted to elucidate relationships of Ruscaceae s.l. and related groups, and parsimony bootstrap analysis was performed to assess support of clades. KEY RESULTS The combination of the three genes results in the most highly resolved and strongly supported topology yet obtained for Asparagales including Ruscaceae s.l. Asparagales relationships are nearly congruent with previous combined gene analyses, which were reflected in the APG III classification. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses yield identical relationships except for some slight variation among the core asparagoid families, which nevertheless form a strongly supported group in both types of analyses. In core asparagoids, five major clades are identified: (1) Alliaceae s.l. (sensu APG III, Amarylidaceae-Agapanthaceae-Alliaceae); (2) Asparagaceae-Laxmanniaceae-Ruscaceae s.l.; (3) Themidaceae; (4) Hyacinthaceae; (5) Anemarrhenaceae-Behniaceae-Herreriaceae-Agavaceae (clades 2-5 collectively Asparagaceae s.l. sensu APG III). The position of Aphyllanthes is labile, but it is sister to Themidaceae in the combined maximum-parsimony tree and sister to Anemarrhenaceae in the Bayesian analysis. The highly supported clade of Xanthorrhoeaceae s.l. (sensu APG III, including Asphodelaceae and Hemerocallidaceae) is sister to the core asparagoids. Ruscaceae s.l. are a well-supported group. Asparagaceae s.s. are sister to Ruscaceae s.l., even though the clade of the two families is weakly supported; Laxmanniaceae are strongly supported as sister to Ruscaceae s.l. and Asparagaceae. Ruscaceae s.l. include six principal clades that often reflect previously named groups: (1) tribe Polygonateae (excluding Disporopsis); (2) tribe Ophiopogoneae; (3) tribe Convallarieae (excluding Theropogon); (4) Ruscaceae s.s. + Dracaenaceae + Theropogon + Disporopsis + Comospermum; (5) Nolinaceae, (6) Eriospermum. CONCLUSIONS The analyses here were largely conducted with new data collected for the same loci as in previous studies, but in this case from different species/DNA accessions and greater sampling in many cases than in previously published analyses; nonetheless, the results largely mirror those of previously conducted studies. This demonstrates the robustness of these results and answers questions often raised about reproducibility of DNA results, given the often sparse sampling of taxa in some studies, particularly the earliest ones. The results also provide a clear set of patterns on which to base a new classification of the subfamilies of Asparagaceae s.l., particularly Ruscaceae s.l. (= Nolinoideae of Asparagaceae s.l.), and examine other putatively important characters of Asparagales.},

Ruppia taxonomy has been confusing because of its simplified morphology yet high phenotypic plasticity and the existence of polyploidy and putative hybrids. This study addresses the current classification of species in the genus, the origin of putative hybrids and polyploids, and the distribution of Ruppia species. • METHODS Separate molecular phylogenetic analyses using plastid DNA and nuclear-encoded PHYB data sets were performed after chromosome observations. • KEY RESULTS The resultant trees were largely congruent between genomes, but were incongruent in two respects: the first incongruence may be caused by long outgroup branches and their effect on ingroup rooting, and the second is caused by the existence of heterogeneous PHYB sequences for several accessions that may reflect several independent hybridization events. Several morphological species recognized in previous taxonomic revisions appear paraphyletic in plastid DNA and PHYB trees. • CONCLUSIONS Given the molecular phylogenies, and considering chromosome number and morphology, three species and one species complex comprising six lineages were discerned. A putative allotriploid, an allotetraploid, and a lineage of hybrid origin were identified within the species complex, and a hybrid was found outside the species complex, and their respective putative parental taxa were inferred. With respect to biogeography, a remarkably discontinuous distribution was identified in two cases, for which bird-mediated seed dispersal may be a reasonable explanation.},

	abstract = {Galium L. is the largest genus in the tribe Rubieae, with about 667 species distributed worldwide. Previous researches mainly focused on species from the Americas and Europe. In the present paper, we greatly increased the number of samples examined from eastern Asia (especially China), representing the most comprehensive sampling of Galium to date. A total of 194 species and variations (subspecies) of Galium were sampled to determine phylogenetic relationships, using two nuclear and five chloroplast markers. Our data are largely consistent with all previous phylogenetic results and confirmed that Galium is non-monophyletic, as are most of its sections. Most members of Galium, including the Chinese taxa, fall into three large clades mixed with other genera from the Galium s.l. group; the exception being the distinct Galium paradoxum Maxim., the first diverged lineage in the Galium s.l. group, which was treated as a new genus (Pseudogalium L.-E. Yang, Z.-L. Nie \& H. Sun, gen. nov.). The Galium s.s is a well-supported clade comprised entirely of Galium species, usually with six or more leaves per whorl, mostly from the Old World. Samples from G. maximowiczii (Kom.) Pobed, G. sect. Depauperata and sect. Aparinoides, together with a few from Asperula sect. Glabella and Microphysa (Schrenk ex Fisch. \& C.A. Mey.) Pobed., form the second clade. The third clade comprises taxa purely from Galium that usually have four leaves per whorl, from both the New and Old World. Our results also indicated that the monotypic genus Microphysa should be retained and clarified phylogenetic relationships of some specific confused taxa from China. Unlike prior inferences, the combination of opposite leaves associated with two stipules is proposed as the ancestral characteristic of the Galium s.l. group and even the tribe. In addition, the shapes of different corolla and inflorescence types are important for distinguishing some taxa within Rubieae.},

	abstract = {Guihaiothamnus (Rubiaceae) is an enigmatic, monotypic genus endemic to southwestern China. Its generic status has never been doubted because it is morphologically unique by having rosette habit, showy, long-corolla-tubed flowers, and multi-seeded indehiscent berry-like fruits. The genus has been postulated to be a relict in the broad-leaved forests of China, and to be related to the genus Wendlandia, which was placed in the subfamily Cinchonoideae and recently classified in the tribe Augusteae of the subfamily Dialypetalanthoideae. Using combined evidence from palynology, cytology, and DNA sequences of nuclear ITS and four plastid markers (rps16, trnT-F, ndhF, rbcL), we assessed the phylogenetic position of Guihaiothamnus in Rubiaceae. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses placed the genus deeply nested within Wendlandia. This relationship is corroborated by evidence from palynology and cytology. Using a relaxed molecular clock method based on five fossil records, we dated the stem age of Wendlandia to be 17.46 my and, the split between G. acaulis and related Wendlandia species in southwestern China to be 2.11mya. This young age, coupled with the derived position in Wendlandia, suggests an evolutionary derivation rather than an evolutionary relict of G. acaulis. Its rosette habit and large showy flowers, which are very distinctive from other Wendlandias, are interpreted as a result of recent rapid adaptation to rock and cliff habitats.},

	abstract = {Every plant species on Earth interacts in some way or another with microorganisms and it is well known that certain forms of symbiosis between different organisms can drive evolution. Within some clades of Rubiaceae (coffee family), a specific plant-bacteria interaction exists in which non-pathological endophytes are present in the leaves of their hosts. It is hypothesized that the bacterial endophytes, either alone or by interacting with the host, provide chemical protection against herbivory or pathogens by producing toxic or otherwise advantageous secondary metabolites. If the bacteria indeed have a direct beneficial influence on their hosts, it is reasonable to assume that the endophytes may increase the fitness of their hosts and therefore it is probable that their presence also has an influence on the long-term evolution of the particular plant lineages. In this study, the possible origin in time of non-nodulated bacterial leaf symbiosis in the Vanguerieae tribe of Rubiaceae is elucidated and dissimilarities in evolutionary dynamics between species with endophytes versus species without are investigated. Bacterial leaf symbiosis is shown to have most probably originated in the Late Miocene, a period when the savannah habitat is believed to have expanded on the African continent and herbivore pressure increased. The presence of bacterial leaf endophytes appears to be restricted to Old World lineages so far. Plant lineages with leaf endophytes show a significantly higher speciation rate than plant lineages without endophytes, while there is only a small difference in extinction rate. The transition rate shows that evolving towards having endophytes is twice as fast as evolving towards not having endophytes, suggesting that leaf symbiosis must be beneficial for the host plants. We conclude that the presence of bacterial leaf endophytes may also be an important driver for speciation of host plants.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY It is well known that mutualistic bacteria can provide substantial benefits to their host plants. However, 'how,' 'why,' and the possible applications of such an interaction are only second to the questions 'who is involved?', and 'where does it occur?'. In the coffee family (Rubiaceae), certain species closely interact with endophytic leaf bacteria that are freely distributed among the mesophyll cells. This type of interaction was recently discovered in South Africa. Our aim is to document the bacterial diversity associated with Rubiaceae ('who') and to establish the geographic range of the interaction ('where'). METHODS Representatives of the Vanguerieae tribe in Rubiaceae were investigated for the presence of endophytes with special emphasis on the distributional range of the plant-bacteria association by collecting specimens from different African regions. KEY RESULTS The interaction is found in five genera and is restricted to three major host lineages. The endophytic bacteria belong to the genus Burkholderia and are part of the plant-associated beneficial and environmental group. Some endophytes are similar to B. caledonica, B. graminis, B. phenoliruptrix or B. phytofirmans, while others are classified in OTUs that show no similarity with any previously described Burkholderia species of bacteria. CONCLUSIONS The association is not obligate from the bacterial point of view and is considered a loose and recent interaction, which is demonstrated by the fact that there is no evidence for coevolution. The geographical distribution of the association is restricted by the distributional range of the host plants covering the whole of sub-Saharan Africa.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY Dioecy occurs in only about 6\% of angiosperms, yet it has evolved many times from hermaphroditism. Polygamy is an even more uncommon condition within angiosperms, in which both unisexual and bisexual flowers occur within a species. Polygamy, dioecy, and hermaphroditism all occur within a New World clade of Galium (Rubiaceae), in which dioecy is hypothesized to have evolved from hermaphroditism via polygamy. At least five sections of Galium as traditionally defined by fruit morphology occur within this group. We tested the monophyly of sections defined by fruit morphology and sought to determine origins and pathways of breeding systems within this group. • METHODS We obtained chloroplast (rpoB-trnC, trnC-psbM, trnL-ndhJ) and nuclear ribosomal (external transcribed spacer) DNA sequences for 89 taxa from the Cruciata-Galium-Valantia (CGV) clade to estimate the phylogeny. Ancestral states for breeding systems, fruit types, and fruit hairs were reconstructed using parsimony and likelihood analyses. • KEY RESULTS We identified nine well-supported lineages of New World Galium taxa. However, none of the sections traditionally defined by fruit morphology are monophyletic. Dioecy is inferred to have arisen at least three times from hermaphroditism; polygamy is inferred to have arisen at least twice from dioecy and at least six times from hermaphroditism. • CONCLUSIONS Polygamy appears to be a terminal condition in the CGV clade and not a pathway to dioecy. Fruit characters traditionally used in the taxonomy of this group have arisen multiple times within this clade of Galium and are not reliable indicators of shared evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {In this study we explore what historical biogeographic events are responsible for the wide and disjunct distribution of extant species in Lasiantheae, a pantropical group of trees and shrubs in the coffee family. Three of the genera in the group, Lasianthus, Saldinia, and Trichostachys, are found to be monophyletic, while there are indications that the fourth, Ronabea, is paraphyletic. We also address how the uncertainty in topology and divergence times affects the level of confidence in the biogeographic reconstruction. A data set consisting of chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal DNA data was analyzed using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach to estimate phylogenetic relationships and divergence times, and the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) method to reconstruct geographic range evolution. Our results show that the Lasiantheae stem lineage originated in the neotropics, and the group expanded its range to the palaeotropics during the Eocene, either by continental migration through the boreotropics or by transatlantic long-distance dispersal. Two cases of Oligocene/Miocene over water-dispersal were also inferred, once from the paleotropics to the neotropics within Lasianthus, and once to Madagascar, concurrent with the origin of Saldinia. A lot of the diversification within Lasianthus took place during the Miocene and may have been influenced by climatic factors such as a period of markedly warm and moist climate in Asia and the aridification of the interior of the African continent. When biogeographic reconstructions were averaged over a random sample of 1000 dated phylogenies, the confidence in the biogeographic reconstruction decreased for most nodes, compared to when a single topology was used. A good understanding of phylogenetic relationships is necessary to understand the biogeographic history of a group, bit since the phylogeny is rarely completely known it is important to include phylogenetic uncertainty in biogeographic analysis. For nodes where the resolution is uncertain, the use of a single "best" topology as a basis for biogeographic analysis will result in inflated confidence in a biogeographic reconstruction which may be just one of several possible reconstructions.},

This problem is more complicated in Psychotrieae due to the paraphyly of the genus Psychotria, the lack of diagnostic characters for some major lineages, and the poor sampling from some biodiversity hotspots. Schizocarps and bacterial leaf nodules have been used for recognizing formal groups in Psychotrieae, but their evolution and taxonomic value have not been studied using a robust phylogeny of the tribe.• Methods: We analyzed 287 samples from the entire ranges of the tribes, with particular emphasis on the Western Indian Ocean region, with the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method.• Key results: All allied Psychotria genera investigated are nested within a paraphyletic Psychotria. Schizocarps evolved independently two times within Psychotria, and one reversal back to the drupaceous condition is inferred. The Malagasy leaf-nodulated Psychotrieae (except Apomuria bullata) and the Comorian non-leaf-nodulated Psychotria conocarpa are nested within the (African) leaf-nodulated clade. Within Palicoureeae, Chassalia is paraphyletic with respect to Geophila sensu stricto, and the Malagasy Geophila gerrardii and the African Hymenocoleus are closely related.• Conclusions: A widely circumscribed Psychotria encompassing the entire Psychotrieae is supported. Within Psychotria, two separate origins of schizocarps from drupes, one reversal back to the drupaceous condition, and two independent origins of the Malagasy leaf-nodulated species are inferred. A new genus Puffia is described to accommodate Geophila gerrardii, and a narrow circumscription of Chassalia is adopted. Thirty-two new combinations, two lectotypifications, and 25 new names are presented.},

	abstract = {The biologically interesting ant-plant association, myrmecophytism, occurs in ca. 140 of the 11,000 species and 22 of the 630 genera of the coffee family (Rubiaceae). These myrmecophytic Rubiaceae species are predominantly distributed in Southeast Asia, especially the Malesian region, with comparatively few species in mainland Africa and the Neotropics. The mostly Southeast Asian genus Neonauclea s.s is one of the three Rubiaceae genera with extensive radiation of myrmecophytes and also the most speciose genus of the tribe Naucleeae s.l. We perform parsimony phylogenetic analyses of Neonauclea s.s., previously resolved as paraphyletic, and its allied genera using both ETS and ITS sequencing data to test: (1) the paraphyly of Neonauclea s.s.; (2) the phylogenetic relationships within the Ludekia-Myrmeconauclea-Neonauclea complex; and (3) the evolution of myrmecophytism within the complex. The earlier proposed paraphyly of Neonauclea s.s. appears to be the result of the combined effects of parallel substitutions in Metadina trichotoma and the sampled ITS putative pseudogenes of Neonauclea longipedunculata and losses of some synapomorphies of Neonauclea s.s. in the latter. The analyses present strong support for the monophyly of Myrmeconauclea and Neonauclea s.s. and their sister-group relationships. Our findings additionally favor the hypothesis of multiple origins of myrmecophytism in the Bornean Neonauclea, which have independently been exploited by at least three Cladomyrma ant species. Furthermore, we interpret the low levels of variation in both the ETS and ITS sequences as indication of a recent and rapid radiation for Neonauclea s.s. (with 65 species) and a recent and slow radiation for Myrmeconauclea (with three species). We argue that the rapid diversification of Neonauclea s.s. is partly associated with the nature of its fruits and its ability to colonize a wide range of habitats. We postulate that both ecological and geographical events may have been responsible for the radiation of the non-myrmecophytic Neonauclea species. Finally, we argue that the acquisition of the pseudo-multiple fruits and long-tailed seeds has allowed Myrmeconauclea to specialize on rheophytic habitats but its narrow ecological tolerance may have hindered its speciation.},

Within Morindeae the type genus Morinda is traditionally and currently circumscribed based on its head inflorescences and syncarpous fruits (syncarps). These characters are also present in some members of its allied genera, raising doubts about the monophyly of Morinda. We perform Bayesian phylogenetic analyses using combined nrETS/nrITS/trnT-F data for 67 Morindeae taxa and five outgroups from the closely related tribes Mitchelleae and Gaertnereae to rigorously test the monophyly of Morinda as currently delimited and assess the phylogenetic value of head inflorescences and syncarps in Morinda and Morindeae and to evaluate generic relationships and limits in Morindeae. Our analyses demonstrate that head inflorescences and syncarps in Morinda and Morindeae are evolutionarily labile. Morinda is highly paraphyletic, unless the genera Coelospermum, Gynochthodes, Pogonolobus, and Sarcopygme are also included. Morindeae comprises four well-supported and morphologically distinct major lineages: Appunia clade, Morinda clade (including Sarcopygme and the lectotype M. royoc), Coelospermum clade (containing Pogonolobus and Morinda reticulata), and Gynochthodes-Morinda clade. Four possible alternatives for revising generic boundaries are presented to establish monophyletic units. We favor the recognition of the four major lineages of Morindeae as separate genera, because this classification reflects the occurrence of a considerable morphological diversity in the tribe and the phylogenetic and taxonomic distinctness of its newly delimited genera.},

	abstract = {The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA has been widely used by systematists for reconstructing phylogenies of closely related taxa. Although the occurrence of ITS putative pseudogenes is well documented for many groups of animals and plants, the potential utility of these pseudogenes in phylogenetic analyses has often been underestimated or even ignored in part because of deletions that make unambiguous alignment difficult. In addition, long branches often can lead to spurious relationships, particularly in parsimony analyses. We have discovered unusually high levels of ITS polymorphism (up to 30\%, 40\%, and 14\%, respectively) in three tropical tree species of the coffee family (Rubiaceae), Adinauclea fagifolia, Haldina cordifolia, and Mitragyna rubrostipulata. Both secondary structure stability and patterns of nucleotide substitutions in a highly conserved region (5.8S gene) were used for distinguishing presumed functional sequences from putative pseudogenes. The combination of both criteria was the most powerful approach. The sequences from A. fagifolia appear to be a mix of functional genes and highly distinct putative pseudogenes, whereas those from H. cordifolia and M. rubrostipulata were identified as putative pseudogenes. We explored the potential utility of the identified putative pseudogenes in the phylogenetic analyses of Naucleeae sensu lato. Both Bayesian and parsimony trees identified the same monophyletic groups and indicated that the polymorphisms do not transcend species boundaries, implying that they do not predate the divergence of these three species. The resulting trees are similar to those produced by previous analyses of chloroplast genes. In contrast to results of previous studies therefore, divergent putative pseudogenes can be useful for phylogenetic analyses, especially when no sequences of their functional counterparts are available. Our studies clearly show that ITS polymorphism may not necessarily mislead phylogenetic inference. Despite using many different PCR conditions (different primers, higher denaturing temperatures, and absence or presence of DMSO and BSA-TMACl), we recovered only a few functional ITS copies from A. fagifolia and none from H. cordifolia and M. rubrostipulata, which suggests that PCR selection is occurring and/or the presumed functional alleles are located at minor loci (with few ribosomal DNA copies).},

We conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis of 29 taxa including 61 samples from the tribe Morindeae to elucidate the geographical origin of G. boninensis by determining its progenitor species. We also investigated evolutionary transitions among different sexual systems within this plant group. The combined ETS, ITS, and trnT-F sequence data showed that G. boninensis formed a monophyletic group, but it did not form a clade with G. umbellata, which was treated as the same species, whereas it formed a clade with G. parvifolia, which is distributed in southeastern Asia. This suggests that G. boninensis evolved independently from G. umbellata, and probably originated from a progenitor native to southeastern Asia. In the clade composed of the three species of G. boninensis, G. parvifolia, and G. umbellata, only G. boninensis is androdioecious, whereas the others are dioecious. Thus, the androdioecious sexual system of G. boninensis may have evolved from dioecy.},

Testing the monophyly of these groups of plants is an important step toward the establishment of a phylogenetic classification. The genus Ixora of the tribe Ixoreae in the subfamily Ixoroideae (coffee family or Rubiaceae) is a species-rich pantropical genus of ca. 500 species. Phylogenetic analyses of Ixoreae based on combined sequence data from one nuclear (nrETS) and two chloroplast (rps16 and trnT-F) markers reveal the paraphyly of Ixora as presently delimited and also show that the tribe can be subdivided into three major clades: the Mascarene/neotropical/Malagasy/African clade, the Pacific clade, and the Asian clade. Given the lack of morphological synapomorphies supporting the different Ixora clades and the morphological consistency of the ingroup taxa, we propose a broad circumscription of Ixora including all its satellite genera: Captaincookia, Doricera, Hitoa, Myonima, Sideroxyloides, Thouarsiora, and Versteegia. The current infrageneric classification of Ixora is not supported. The different Ixora subclades represent geographical units. Nuclear and chloroplast tree topologies were partially incongruent, indicating at least four potential natural hybridization events. Other conflicting positions for the cultivated species are most likely due to anthropogenic hybridization.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The phylogenetic relationships between species of Coffea and Psilanthus remain poorly understood, owing to low levels of sequence variation recovered in previous studies, coupled with relatively limited species sampling. In this study, the relationships between Coffea and Psilanthus species are assessed based on substantially increased molecular sequence data and greatly improved species sampling. METHODS Phylogenetic relationships are assessed using parsimony, with sequence data from four plastid regions [trnL-F intron, trnL-F intergenic spacer (IGS), rpl16 intron and accD-psa1 IGS], and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear rDNA (ITS 1/5.8S/ITS 2). Supported lineages in Coffea are discussed within the context of geographical correspondence, biogeography, morphology and systematics. KEY RESULTS Several major lineages with geographical coherence, as identified in previous studies based on smaller data sets, are supported. Other lineages with either geographical or ecological correspondence are recognized for the first time. Coffea subgenus Baracoffea is shown to be monophyletic, but Coffea subgenus Coffea is paraphyletic. Sequence data do not substantiate the monophyly of either Coffea or Psilanthus. Low levels of sequence divergence do not allow detailed resolution of relationships within Coffea, most notably for species of Coffea subgenus Coffea occurring in Madagascar. The origin of C. arabica by recent hybridization between C. canephora and C. eugenioides is supported. Phylogenetic separation resulting from the presence of the Dahomey Gap is inferred based on sequence data from Coffea.},

For Hedyotis, the nuclear 5S-NTS was shown to be potentially as useful as ITS, despite its shorter sequence length. The chloroplast region being the most phylogenetically informative was the petD group II intron. We also present a phylogeny of Spermacoceae based on a Bayesian analysis of the four chloroplast regions, ITS, and ETS combined. Spermacoceae are shown to be monophyletic. Clades supported by high posterior probabilities are discussed, especially in respect to the current generic classification. Notably, Oldenlandia is polyphyletic, the two subgenera of Kohautia are not sister taxa, and Hedyotis should be treated in a narrow sense to include only Asian species.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY The Condamineeae have in previous molecular studies been shown to be part of an early-divergent clade within the subfamily Ixoroideae, together with the tribes Calycophylleae, and Hippotideae, and genera of the former Cinchoneae and Rondeletieae. Generic relationships within this clade have, however, remained largely unresolved. • METHODS In this study, the systematics of the Condamineeae was further examined by phylogenetic reconstruction of six cpDNA regions and one nrDNA region using parsimony and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo inference. Morphological character evolution within the tribe was assessed by ancestral state reconstruction using likelihood optimization of characters onto Bayesian trees. • KEY RESULTS Calycophylleae appears polyphyletic. "Hippotideae" is monophyletic but nested within the Condamineeae. The phylogenetic hypotheses presented support a resurrection of the genera Holtonia, Schizocalyx, and Semaphyllanthe. Furthermore, Bathysa is found to be polyphyletic, Tresanthera is found nested within Rustia, and the taxonomically disputed genus Dialypetalanthus is here shown to be sister to a Bothriospora-Wittmackanthus clade. Morphological ancestral state reconstructions indicate that protogyny have evolved at least two times within the tribe and that indehiscent fruits, loculicidal fruit dehiscence, and intrapetiolar stipules have evolved independently several times. The occurrence of calycophylls (leaf-like calyx lobes), poricidal anthers, and winged seeds also appear homoplastic within the tribe. • CONCLUSIONS A diagnosis and delimitation of the tribe Condamineeae is presented, with taxonomic proposals to synonymize Tresanthera and to transfer several species of Bathysa as well as Phitopis to a resurrected Schizocalyx.},

Due to its proportionally large number of Madagascan endemics, the taxonomically troublesome Spermacoceae tribe is an interesting group to investigate the origin and evolution of the herbaceous Rubiaceae endemic to Madagascar. The phylogenetic position of these endemics were inferred using four plastid gene markers. Age estimates were obtained by expanding the Spermacoceae dataset with representatives of all Rubiaceae tribes. This allowed incorporation of multiple fossil-based calibration points from the Rubiaceae fossil record. Despite the high morphological diversity of the endemic herbaceous Spermacoceae on Madagascar, only two colonization events gave rise to their current diversity. The first clade contains Lathraeocarpa, Phylohydrax and Gomphocalyx, whereas the second Madagascan clade includes the endemic genera Astiella, Phialiphora, Thamnoldenlandia and Amphistemon. The tribe Spermacoceae is estimated to have a Late Eocene origin, and diversified during Oligocene and Miocene. The two Madagascan clades of the tribe originated in the Oligocene and radiated in the Miocene. The origin of the Madagascan Spermacoceae cannot be explained by Gondwanan vicariance but only by means of Cenozoic long distance dispersal events. Interestingly, not only colonization from Africa occurred but also long distance dispersal from the Neotropics shaped the current diversity of the Spermacoceae tribe on Madagascar.},

For molecular studies, progress has been limited by low levels of sequence divergence, leading to insufficient topological resolution and statistical support in phylogenetic trees, particularly for the major lineages and for the numerous species occurring in Madagascar. We report here the first almost fully resolved, broadly sampled phylogenetic hypothesis for coffee, the result of combining genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technology with a newly developed, lab-based workflow to integrate short read next-generation sequencing for low numbers of additional samples. Biogeographic patterns indicate either Africa or Asia (or possibly the Arabian Peninsula) as the most likely ancestral locality for the origin of the coffee genus, with independent radiations across Africa, Asia, and the Western Indian Ocean Islands (including Madagascar and Mauritius). The evolution of caffeine, an important trait for commerce and society, was evaluated in light of our phylogeny. High and consistent caffeine content is found only in species from the equatorial, fully humid environments of West and Central Africa, possibly as an adaptive response to increased levels of pest predation. Moderate caffeine production, however, evolved at least one additional time recently (between 2 and 4Mya) in a Madagascan lineage, which suggests that either the biosynthetic pathway was already in place during the early evolutionary history of coffee, or that caffeine synthesis within the genus is subject to convergent evolution, as is also the case for caffeine synthesis in coffee versus tea and chocolate.},

Previous morphological and phylogenetic studies with a paucity of Asian taxa suggested that Hedyotis should include only Asian species characterized by diplophragmous capsules. In order to test the reliability of this conclusion, assess the phylogenetic value of capsular characters, and evaluate generic circumscriptions in this complex, a phylogenetic study based on expanded inclusion of 63 Asian species was performed using two nuclear regions and eight plastid regions with parsimony and likelihood analyses. The results show that the Hedyotis-Oldenlandia complex is a highly polyphyletic group. Hedyotis should only include most Asian species with erect, robust herbs or shrubs and diplophragmous capsules. Oldenlandia s. str. consists primarily of African species, including the type O. corymbosa, that are characterized by small herbs, paniculate or corymbose inflorescences, inserted styles and stamens, and loculicidally dehiscent capsules. Dimetia, Scleromitrion and Thecagonum are proposed to be resurrected to accommodate three newly resolved clades. Morphological character optimizations indicate that the diplophragmous capsule evolved independently twice within this complex. Plant habit, stipule shape, and capsular dehiscent pattern are of great value in generic circumscriptions.},

While many studies have addressed the evolution of dioecy and/or its relationship with the evolution of the woody habit, few have explored the relationship between dioecy and climbing habit, and their effects on diversification rates. Here, we study the evolution of sexual systems and growth habit in Mussaenda (Rubiaceae) using a robust phylogeny of the genus based on eight plastid regions and a broad sampling of taxa (92 of the 132 species were sampled). A time-calibrated tree was constructed to estimate diversification rates in different clades and its correlates with focal characters. More specifically, we assess evolutionary correlations between dioecy and climbing habit and their respective influences on diversification rates. Ancestral character state reconstructions revealed that distyly is the most likely ancestral state in Mussaenda. Distyly has subsequently given rise to dioecy, short-styled floral monomorphism, and long-styled floral monomorphism. Dioecy has evolved independently at least four times from distyly, and has reversed to homostylous hermaphroditism at least twice, which does not support the "evolutionary dead end" hypothesis. A significant correlation between the evolution of dioecy and climbing growth form was found in Mussaenda. It is possible that a strong association between high net diversification rates and dioecy may exist in Mussaenda, but no association was found with climbing habit.},

	abstract = {New Caledonia is a remote archipelago of the South-West Pacific, whose flora is rich, distinctive, and disharmonic. The interest of botanists has long been attracted by the spatio-temporal origin of this flora, but little attention has been paid to the modes of colonization and the diversification processes that have led to the archipelago's modern flora. To date, no explosive plant radiation has yet been highlighted for New Caledonia. A dated phylogenetic framework on the second richest New Caledonian genus--Psychotria s.l. and its allied genera (tribes Psychotrieae and Palicoureeae, Rubiaceae; ca. 85 species)--is provided in this study to explore its patterns of colonization and diversification in the archipelago. This study is based on a comprehensive species sampling, two nuclear and four plastid loci. Results show that New Caledonia was colonized four times by Psychotria and its allied genera during the Neogene long after its mid-Eocene re-emergence from the sea. The Pacific clade of Psychotrieae, one of the largest plant diversifications in the Pacific islands and the Indo-Pacific region, is absent from New Caledonia, possibly due to niche competition. Although the four lineages colonized New Caledonia relatively simultaneously during the Neogene, they express different evolutionary histories, as revealed by unevenness in species richness and net diversification rates. The genus Geophila has not diversified on New Caledonia, as a non-endemic single species has been documented in the archipelago. The genus Margaritopsis had a moderate level of diversification (four species) similar to that on other Pacific islands. The Psychotria clade NC1 appears to be a relictual lineage, which probably underwent a drastic extinction, with a narrow ecological habitat and dispersal limitations. The Psychotria clade NC2 is the largest and youngest New Caledonian plant radiation, and has undergone the fastest recorded diversification of any endemic lineage in the archipelago, and could be the result of a 'non-adaptive radiation', originating from Australian rainforests.},

Our phylogenetic analyses suggested that Rosa sections Chinenses and Synstylae defined in traditional taxonomic system are not monophyletic and close to sections Caninae and Gallicanae. Additionally, our results showed incongruence between chloroplast and nuclear markers, and the patterns of incongruence might be due to ancient hybridization (genetic introgression).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The genus Pyrus belongs to the tribe Pyreae (the former subfamily Maloideae) of the family Rosaceae, and includes one of the most important commercial fruit crops, pear. The phylogeny of Pyrus has not been definitively reconstructed. In our previous efforts, the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) revealed a poorly resolved phylogeny due to non-concerted evolution of nrDNA arrays. Therefore, introns of low copy nuclear genes (LCNG) are explored here for improved resolution. However, paralogs and lineage sorting are still two challenges for applying LCNGs in phylogenetic studies, and at least two independent nuclear loci should be compared. In this work the second intron of LEAFY and the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) were selected to investigate their molecular evolution and phylogenetic utility. RESULTS DNA sequence analyses revealed a complex ortholog and paralog structure of Adh genes in Pyrus and Malus, the pears and apples. Comparisons between sequences from RT-PCR and genomic PCR indicate that some Adh homologs are putatively nonfunctional. A partial region of Adh1 was sequenced for 18 Pyrus species and three subparalogs representing Adh1-1 were identified. These led to poorly resolved phylogenies due to low sequence divergence and the inclusion of putative recombinants. For the second intron of LEAFY, multiple inparalogs were discovered for both LFY1int2 and LFY2int2. LFY1int2 is inadequate for phylogenetic analysis due to lineage sorting of two inparalogs. LFY2int2-N, however, showed a relatively high sequence divergence and led to the best-resolved phylogeny. This study documents the coexistence of outparalogs and inparalogs, and lineage sorting of these paralogs and orthologous copies. It reveals putative recombinants that can lead to incorrect phylogenetic inferences, and presents an improved phylogenetic resolution of Pyrus using LFY2int2-N. CONCLUSIONS Our study represents the first phylogenetic analyses based on LCNGs in Pyrus. Ancient and recent duplications lead to a complex structure of Adh outparalogs and inparalogs in Pyrus and Malus, resulting in neofunctionalization, nonfunctionalization and possible subfunctionalization. Among all investigated orthologs, LFY2int2-N is the best nuclear marker for phylogenetic reconstruction of Pyrus due to suitable sequence divergence and the absence of lineage sorting.},

In this study, we collected 110 accessions representing 25 Pyrus species and constructed both phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic networks based on multiple DNA sequence datasets. Phylogenetic trees based on both cpDNA and nuclear LFY2int2-N (LN) data resulted in poor resolution, especially, only five primary species were monophyletic in the LN tree. A phylogenetic network of LN suggested that reticulation caused by hybridization is one of the major evolutionary processes for Pyrus species. Polytomies of the gene trees and star-like structure of cpDNA networks suggested rapid radiation is another major evolutionary process, especially for the occidental species. Pyrus calleryana and P. regelii were the earliest diverged Pyrus species. Two North African species, P. cordata, P. spinosa and P. betulaefolia were descendent of primitive stock Pyrus species and still share some common molecular characters. Southwestern China, where a large number of P. pashia populations are found, is probably the most important diversification center of Pyrus. More accessions and nuclear genes are needed for further understanding the evolutionary histories of Pyrus.},

A total of 228 Rosaceous RGHs were deeply separated into two distinct clades, designated as TIR (sequences within this clade containing a Toll Interleukin-1 Receptor domain) and NonTIR (sequences lacking a TIR domain). Most Rosaceous RGH genes were phylogenetically distinct from Arabidopsis, Rice or Pine genes, except for a few Rosaceous members which grouped closely with Arabidopsis genes. Within Rosaceae, sequences from multiple species were often phylogenetically clustered together, forming heterogenous groups, however, apple- and chestnut rose-specific groups really exist. Gene duplication followed by sequence divergence were proposed as the mode for the evolution of a large number of distantly or closely related RGH genes in Rosaceae, and this mode may play a role in the generation of new resistance specificity. Positively selected sites within NBS-coding region were detected and thus nucleotide variation within NBS domain may function in determining disease resistance specificity. This study also discusses the synteny of a genomic region that encompass powdery mildew resistance locus among Malus, Prunus and Rosa, which may have potential use for fruit tree disease breeding and important gene cloning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Within Rosaceae, the RNase based gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system has been studied at the molecular level in Maloideae and Prunus species that have been diverging for, at least, 32 million years. In order to understand RNase based GSI evolution within this family, comparative studies must be performed, using similar methodologies. RESULT It is here shown that many features are shared between the two species groups such as levels of recombination at the S-RNase (the S-pistil component) gene, and the rate at which new specificities arise. Nevertheless, important differences are found regarding the number of ancestral lineages and the degree of specificity sharing between closely related species. In Maloideae, about 17\% of the amino acid positions at the S-RNase protein are found to be positively selected, and they occupy about 30\% of the exposed protein surface. Positively selected amino acid sites are shown to be located on either side of the active site cleft, an observation that is compatible with current models of specificity determination. At positively selected amino acid sites, non-conservative changes are almost as frequent as conservative changes. There is no evidence that at these sites the most drastic amino acid changes may be more strongly selected. CONCLUSIONS Many similarities are found between the GSI system of Prunus and Maloideae that are compatible with the single origin hypothesis for RNase based GSI. The presence of common features such as the location of positively selected amino acid sites and lysine residues that may be important for ubiquitylation, raise a number of issues that, in principle, can be experimentally addressed in Maloideae. Nevertheless, there are also many important differences between the two Rosaceae GSI systems. How such features changed during evolution remains a puzzling issue.},

	abstract = {Species in the ivesioid clade of Potentilla (Rosaceae) are endemic to western North America, an area that underwent widespread aridification during the global temperature decrease following the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. Several morphological features interpreted as adaptations to drought are found in the clade, and many species occupy extremely dry habitats. Recent phylogenetic analyses have shown that the sister group of this clade is Potentilla section Rivales, a group with distinct moist habitat preferences. This has led to the hypothesis that the ivesioids (genera Ivesia, Horkelia and Horkeliella) diversified in response to the late Tertiary aridification of western North America. We used phyloclimatic modeling and a fossil-calibrated dated phylogeny of the family Rosaceae to investigate the evolution of the ivesioid clade. We have combined occurrence- and climate data from extant species, and used ancestral state reconstruction to model past climate preferences. These models have been projected into paleo-climatic scenarios in order to identify areas where the ivesioids may have occurred. Our analysis suggests a split between the ivesioids and Potentilla sect. Rivales around Late Oligocene/Early Miocene (∼23 million years ago, Ma), and that the ivesioids then diversified at a time when summer drought started to appear in the region. The clade is inferred to have originated on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains from where a westward range expansion to the Sierra Nevada and the coast of California took place between ∼12-2 Ma. Our results support the idea that climatic changes in southwestern North America have played an important role in the evolution of the local flora, by means of in situ adaptation followed by diversification.},

Interspecific hybrids can form isolated evolutionary units, especially when mechanisms increasing viability and fertility, like polyploidy and apomixis, are involved. A good model system to study reticulate evolution in plants is Rubus subgen. Rubus (brambles, blackberries), which only in Europe includes 748 accepted species, out of which only four are sexual diploids and all others are polyploid apomicts. We employed two molecular markers (ITS and cpDNA) to shed light on the evolutionary history of European bramble flora and main processes generating such high species diversity. We distinguished just six ancestral diploids (including two extinct ones) for both markers, which gave rise to all European polyploid accessions, and revealed an extreme reticulation in bramble evolution. We furthermore detected hybridogenous origins and identified putative parents for several taxa (e.g. ser. Nessenses), while in other groups (e.g. ser. Discolores) we could also infer the direction of hybridization. By comparing different cp haplotypes having clear geographic patterns, we hypothesize that the origin of European brambles can be attributed to both Holocene species range expansion and Pleistocene climate fluctuations.},

	abstract = {Within the genus Rosa numerous species have been described. Circumscription of the dogrose section Caninae is straightforward, but the delineation of species and subsections within this section is less clear, partly due to hybridisation between species. We have investigated the extent to which DNA marker-based information of wild populations corroborates present-day dogrose taxonomy and hypotheses about the origination of taxa. Sampling was conducted in a transect across Europe, collecting over 900 specimens of all encountered dogrose taxa. For comparison, we also included more than 200 samples of species belonging to other sections. Two lines of statistical analyses were used to investigate the genetic structure based on AFLP data: (1) an unstructured model with principal coordinate analysis and hierarchical clustering, and (2) a model with a superimposed taxonomic structure based on analysis of genetic diversity using a novel approach combining assignment tests with canonical discriminant analysis. Support was found for five of the seven subsections, whereas R. balsamica apparently belongs to subsection Caninae thus omitting the need for recognising subsection Tomentellae. For R. stylosa, a hybridogenic origin with a non-dogrose section member has been suggested, and it can be treated either as a separate subsection or within subsection Caninae. Within the subsection Rubigineae, a species cluster with low support for the taxa R. micrantha, R. rubiginosa and the putatively hybridogenous R. gremlii was identified. Similarly, several species in the subsection Caninae overlapped considerably, and are best regarded as one common species complex. This population genetic approach provides a general method to validate the taxonomic system in complex and polyploid taxa.},

However, little is known about the evolution of the species that gave rise to this important fruit crop. Phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast genome sequences of 21 Fragaria species and subspecies resolves the western North American diploid F. vesca subsp. bracteata as sister to the clade of octoploid/decaploid species. No extant tetraploids or hexaploids are directly involved in the maternal ancestry of the octoploids. There is strong geographic segregation of chloroplast haplotypes in subsp. bracteata, and the gynodioecious Pacific Coast populations are implicated as both the maternal lineage and the source of male-sterility in the octoploid strawberries. Analysis of sexual system evolution in Fragaria provides evidence that the loss of male and female function can follow polyploidization, but does not seem to be associated with loss of self-incompatibility following genome doubling. Character-state mapping provided insight into sexual system evolution and its association with loss of self-incompatibility and genome doubling/merger. Fragaria attained its circumboreal and amphitropical distribution within the past one to four million years and the rise of the octoploid clade is dated at 0.372-2.05 million years ago.},

The present study greatly expands phylogenetic analyses of the Pyreae by using a combination of 11 chloroplast regions plus nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences from 486 individuals representing 331 species and 27 genera. Maximum likelihood and bayesian analyses generally support existing generic boundary, although Sorbus, as previously circumscribed, is clearly non-monophyletic. Two significant conflicts were detected between the chloroplast and ITS phylogenies, suggesting that hybridization played a role in the origins of Micromeles and Pseudocydonia. In addition, we provide estimates of the divergence times of the major lineages. Our findings support the view that the major Pyreae lineages were established during the Eocene-Oligocene period, but that most of the modern diversity did not originate until the Miocene. At least five major, early Old World-New World disjunctions were detected and these vicariance events are generally most consistent with movement through the Beringia.},

	abstract = {Explaining how plants from eastern Asia migrated to other Northern Hemisphere regions is still challenging. The genus Sorbus sensu stricto (including c. 88 species) is considered as a good example to illuminate this scenario, due to the wide distribution in the temperate zone and high diversity in the Himalayas and Hengduan Mountains. Based on four nuclear markers (LEAFY-2, GBSSI-1, SBEI and WD) and one chloroplast marker (rps16-trnK), we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationship of Sorbus using 54 taxa (60\% of the genus representing all subgenera, sections, or series and geographical areas in the previous classifications), and estimated divergence time and historical biogeography of the genus. Phylogenetic analyses supported that the subgenera Sorbus and Albo-carmesinae, as defined by traditional morphological characters (such as fruit color), are suitable. However, five clades defined by phylogenetic analysis of the genus are not consistent with traditionally defined sections or series. Molecular dating and biogeographic reconstruction showed that the age of the most recent common ancestor was estimated at 41mya (95\% HPD: 49-35mya) in eastern Asia. Four dispersal events are assumed to explain the wide distribution of Sorbus in the temperate zone and diversification in the edges of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Species dispersed from eastern Asia to the Tianshan Mountains, North America and Europe during the Oligocene and Miocene period. We found that polyploidization occurred multiple times in the subgenus Albo-carmesinae, in the Tianshan Mountains, Himalayas, and H-D Mountains. Finally, we suggest that apomixis, polyploidization, and hybridization may have combined with the multistage uplifting of Himalayas and H-D Mountains (and the subsequent increases in geologic, ecological and climatic heterogeneity) to drive the striking species diversity of Sorbus in this region.},

The systematics of Alchemilla has remained poorly understood, most likely due to confusion resulting from apomixis, polyploidisation and hybridisation, which are frequently observed in the group, and which have led to the description of a large number of (micro-) species. A molecular phylogeny of the genus, including all sections of Alchemilla and Lachemilla as well as five representatives of Aphanes, based on the analysis of the chloroplast trnL-trnF and the nuclear ITS regions is presented here. Gene phylogenies reconstructed from the nuclear and chloroplast sequence data were largely congruent. Limited conflict between the data partitions was observed with respect to a small number of taxa. This is likely to be the result of hybridisation/introgression or incomplete lineage sorting. Four distinct clades were resolved, corresponding to major geographical division and life forms: Eurasian Alchemilla, annual Aphanes, South American Lachemilla and African Alchemilla.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The genus Rosa (150-200 species) is widely distributed throughout temperate and sub-tropical habitats from the northern hemisphere to tropical Asia, with only one tropical African species. In order to better understand the evolution of roses, this study examines infrageneric relationships with respect to conventional taxonomy, considers the extent of allopolyploidization and infers macroevolutionary processes that have led to the current distribution of the genus. METHODS Phylogenetic relationships among 101 species of the genus Rosa were reconstructed using sequences from the plastid psbA-trnH spacer, trnL intron, trnL-F spacer, trnS-G spacer and trnG intron, as well as from nuclear glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which was used to identify putative allopolyploids and infer their possible origins. Chloroplast phylogeny was used to estimate divergence times and reconstruct ancestral areas. KEY RESULTS Most subgenera and sections defined by traditional taxonomy are not monophyletic. However, several clades are partly consistent with currently recognized sections. Allopolyploidy seems to have played an important role in stabilizing intersectional hybrids. Biogeographic analyses suggest that Asia played a central role as a genetic reservoir in the evolution of the genus Rosa. CONCLUSIONS The ancestral area reconstruction suggests that despite an early presence on the American continent, most extant American species are the results of a later re-colonization from Asia, probably through the Bering Land Bridge. The results suggest more recent exchanges between Asia and western North America than with eastern North America. The current distribution of roses from the Synstylae lineage in Europe is probably the result of a migration from Asia approx. 30 million years ago, after the closure of the Turgai strait. Directions for a new sectional classification of the genus Rosa are proposed, and the analyses provide an evolutionary framework for future studies on this notoriously difficult genus.},

	abstract = {A reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships based on three chloroplast DNA markers comprising 98 species of the genus Potentilla and 15 additional genera from the tribe Potentilleae (Rosaceae) is presented. The phylogeny supported the current generic concept of the subtribe Fragariinae and resolved major lineages within the subtribe Potentillinae. Resolved lineages corresponded to the combined genera Argentina, Piletophyllum, and Tylosperma, an European and Asian group of species approximately equivalent to the Trichocarpae Herbaceae sensu Th. Wolf, the series Tormentillae Th. Wolf, a North American clade comprising the genera Horkelia, Horkeliella, and Ivesia, the species Potentilla fragarioides and P. freyniana, and to a taxonomically highly diverse but molecularly little diverged core group of Potentilla, respectively. Age estimates of phylogenetic splits resolved in the Potentilleae using Bayesian inference, suggested a diversification of the tribe in the Eocene and radiation of two major evolutionary lineages corresponding to the Fragariinae and Potentillinae at approximately comparable times. Ancestral area reconstructions based on the recent distribution ranges of species and collection sites of cpDNA haplotypes suggested an Asian origin for Potentilla s.str., and explained the arrival of this still informal taxon in Europe and particularly North America by multiple dispersal events. In combining the phylogenetic and geographic data with molecularly inferred time estimates and taxonomy, strongly contrasting evolutionary patterns were identified. These evolutionary patterns included rapid speciation on a continental and worldwide scale accompanied by multiple intercontinental dispersals opposed to largely diverged lineages of limited taxonomic diversity and vicariant geographic distribution. The molecular-based phylogeographic hypothesis finally is discussed on the background of the fossil record of Potentilla.},

	abstract = {Most previous molecular phylogenetic studies of Prunus have been conducted primarily with crop species and their close relatives. As the center of crop diversity of the genus is in Eurasia, the geographic origin of Prunus has inevitably been inferred to be Eurasia as well. The lesser-known tropical Prunus species have not been well represented in previous phylogenetic reconstructions; therefore, their effects on inferences about the phylogenetic structure and geographic origin of Prunus are uncertain. In this study, we examined the phylogeny of Prunus, including an expanded sampling of species from tropical regions in Southeast Asia and the Americas, using sequences from four plastid markers and the nuclear ribosomal ITS region. A penalized likelihood method was used to estimate the absolute age of Prunus and the timing of infrageneric cladogenic events. The geographic origin of Prunus and ancestral sites of cladogenesis were inferred using the Bayes-DIVA approach. Our results indicate that the modern genus appeared ∼61Myr in eastern Asia and that diversification of all major lineages may have been triggered by the global warming period of the early Eocene. In addition, our molecular dating estimates suggest that the crown clade that includes the temperate deciduous crop species is older than the one that includes the tropical evergreen species, while incongruence between plastid and nuclear phylogenies suggests that the latter lineage originated via an ancient hybridization event. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the temperate crop species was a component of the continuous boreotropical forests of the Northern Hemisphere, while the MRCA of the tropical species represented the last remains of the boreotropical elements and subsequently radiated throughout the Old and New World tropics from refugial areas at lower latitudes. Complex biogeographic histories leading to the present global distribution of the genus were driven by several geologic events, climatic oscillations, and independent dispersals across continents via the Bering and the North Atlantic Land Bridges during different geologic time periods.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Delimitation of Amelanchier species is difficult because of polyploidy and gametophytic apomixis. A first step in unraveling this species problem is understanding the diversity of the diploids that contributed genomes to polyploid apomicts. This research helps clarify challenging species-delimitation problems attending polyploid, apomictic complexity. METHODS We sampled 431 diploid accessions from 13 species, of which 10 are North American and three are Old World. Quantitative morphological analyses tested the null hypothesis of no discrete groups. Using three to nine diploid accessions per species, we constructed phylogenies with DNA sequences from ETS, ITS, the second intron of LEAFY, and chloroplast regions rpoB-trnC, rpl16, trnD-trnT, and ycf6-psbM. KEY RESULTS Most Amelanchier diploid taxa are morphologically and ecogeographically distinct and genetically exclusive lineages. They rarely hybridize with one another. Nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences almost completely resolve the Amelanchier phylogeny. The backbone is the mostly western North American clade A, eastern North American clade B, and Old World clade O. DNA sequences and morphology support clades A and O as sister taxa. Despite extensive paralogy, our LEAFY data are phylogenetically informative and identify a clade (T) of three arborescent taxa within clade B. CONCLUSIONS Amelanchier diploids differ strikingly from polyploid apomicts, in that hybridization among them is rare, and they form taxa that would qualify as species by most species concepts. Knowledge of diploid morphology, phylogeny, and ecogeography provides a foundation for understanding the evolutionary history of polyploid apomicts, their patterns of diversification, and their species status.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs) are remarkable in their species richness and endemism, but the processes that have led to this diversity remain enigmatic. Here, we hypothesize that continent-dependent speciation and extinction rates have led to disparity in diversity between the five MTEs of the world: the Cape, California, Mediterranean Basin, Chile, and Western Australia. To test this hypothesis, we built a phylogenetic tree for 280 Rhamnaceae species, estimated divergence times using eight fossil calibrations, and used Bayesian methods and simulations to test for differences in diversification rates. Rhamnaceae lineages in MTEs generally show higher diversification rates than elsewhere, but speciation and extinction dynamics show a pattern of continent-dependence. We detected high speciation and extinction rates in California and significantly lower extinction rates in the Cape and Western Australia. The independent colonization of four of five MTEs may have occurred conterminously in the Oligocene/Early Miocene, but colonization of the Mediterranean Basin happened later, in the Late Miocene. This suggests that the in situ radiations of these clades were initiated before the onset of winter rainfall in these regions. These results indicate independent evolutionary histories of Rhamnaceae in MTEs, possibly related to the intensity of climate oscillations and the geological history of the regions.},

Sixteen species occur in Madagascar, of which 13 are endemic and three are common to Madagascar and one or more of the smaller Indian Ocean islands. The latter include G. laxiflora Tul., a species which is also present on mainland Africa. One species, G. mauritiana Lam., is endemic to Réunion Island. We recognize two subspecies within G. scandens (Gaertn.) R. B. Drumm.: G. scandens subsp. scandens and G. scandens subsp. glandulosa (Boivin ex Tul.) Buerki, Phillipson \& Callm., the latter transferred from G. glandulosa Boivin ex Tul. Past confusion about the identity of this species is discussed. Five names are lectotypified: G. aphrodes Tul., G. glandulosa [= G. scandens subsp. glandulosa], G. laxiflora, G. lineata Tul., and G. tiliifolia Lam. Both lectotype and epitype are designated for G. mauritiana. Conservation assessments are provided for all species within their primary areas of occurrence.},

	abstract = {The genus Empodisma comprises two species that are ecologically important in wetland habitats. Empodisma gracillimum is restricted to south-western Australia, whereas Empodisma minus is found in Tasmania, eastern Australia and New Zealand. We sequenced three cpDNA genes for 15 individuals of Empodisma sampled from throughout the range of the species. The results support an Australian origin for Empodisma sometime during the late Oligocene to early Miocene with more recent dispersal, colonization and diversification in New Zealand. We recovered six genetically distinct maternal lineages: three Empodisma gracillimum haplotypes corresponding to the three accessions in our analysis, a wide-ranging Empodisma minus haplotype found in eastern Australia and Tasmania, an Empodisma minus haplotype found in New Zealand from Stewart Island to approximately 38° S latitude on the North Island, and a distinct haplotype restricted to the North Island of New Zealand north of 38° S latitude. The Eastern Australian and New Zealand haplotypes of Empodisma minus were supported by only one cpDNA gene, and we felt the relatively minor morphological differences and the small amount of genetic divergence did not warrant taxonomic recognition. However, we recommend that the northern New Zealand haplotype should be recognized as the new species Empodisma robustum and provide descriptions and a key to the species of Empodisma. Monophyly of Empodisma robustum is supported by all three cpDNA genes. Empodisma robustum can be distinguished from Empodisma gracillimum and Empodisma minus by its robust growth stature and distinct ecology. It is typically eliminated by fire and re-establishes by seed (seeder strategy), whereas Empodisma minus and Empodisma gracillimum regrow after fire (sprouter strategy).},

	abstract = {Three commonly used molecular dating methods for correction of variable rates (non-parametric rate smoothing, penalized likelihood, and Bayesian rate correction) as well as the assumption of a global molecular clock were tested for sensitivity to taxon sampling. The test dataset of 6854 basepairs for 300 terminals includes a nearly complete sample of the Restio-clade of the African Restionaceae (272 of the 288 species), as well as 26 outgroup species. Of this, nested subsets of 35, 51, 80, 120, 150, and the full 300 species were used. Molecular dating experiments with these datasets showed that all methods are sensitive to undersampling, but that this effect is more severe in analyses that use more extreme rate smoothing. Additionally, the undersampling effect is positively related to distance from the calibration node. The combined effect of undersampling and distance from the calibration node resulted in up to threefold differences in the age estimation of nodes from the same dataset with the same calibration point. We suggest that the most suitable methods are penalized likelihood and Bayesian when a global clock assumption has been rejected, as these methods are more successful at finding optimal levels of smoothing to correct for rate heterogeneity, and are less sensitive to undersampling.},

Phylogenetic analyses of ITS and plastid trnL-trnF sequences of 66 species from all genera of the Resedaceae reveal (1) monophyly of the family, in congruence with preliminary phylogenetic studies; (2) molecular support for the traditional morphological subdivision of the Resedaceae into three tribes according to ovary and placentation types, and carpel number; (3) two monophyletic genera (Caylusea, Sesamoides), and one natural group (core Reseda), which includes the remaining four genera of the family (Ochradenus, Oligomeris, Randonia, Reseda); (4) a monophyletic origin for four of the six taxonomic sections recognized within Reseda (Leucoreseda, Luteola, Glaucoreseda, Phyteuma). Our results lead us to interpret an increment of the basic chromosome number in the family from x=5 to x=6 in at least two independent instances, and a broad representation of polyploids in multiple lineages across phylogenies, including association between octoploids and alien invasion in many parts of the world. Species diversity, endemism number, phylogenetic relationships and sequence divergence in Resedaceae suggest two major centers of differentiation, one in the western Mediterranean, and the other in the eastern Mediterranean and SW Asia. Two independent colonization events to the Canary Islands from Africa are indicated for the two Canarian Reseda endemics.},

	abstract = {East Asia is characterized by high levels of species diversity and endemism. However, the biogeographical patterns and processes underlying the distribution of biodiversity within the area are still poorly known. In this study, we used plastid (matK, trnL-F, and trnH-psbA) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences to investigate the historical biogeography of Dichocarpum (Ranunculaceae), an eastern Asian endemic genus throughout warm-temperate and subtropical forests of the area. Phylogenetic analyses strongly support Dichocarpum as monophyletic, which contains two major clades. Clade I corresponds to section Hutchinsonia, and clade II includes sections Dichocarpum and Fargesia. Section Dichocarpum and its subsections Dalzielia and Dichocarpum are not recognized as monophyletic. Our results suggest that the most recent common ancestor of Dichocarpum occurred in central China and Japan in the earliest Early Miocene, and thus support an ancient vicariance event between Japan and China. Within mainland China, three migrations at the species level were hypothesized to explain the expansion of Dichocarpum from central China to southeastern Yunnan, Hengduan mountains, and eastern Himalaya. These migration events occurred in the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene, which may be associated with the uplift of the southeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and accordingly the expansion of subtropical forests in China around that period. A migration or dispersal from central China to Taiwan was inferred in the Early Pleistocene, which supports the close floristic affinity between Taiwan and mainland China. This study contributes to our knowledge on the historical biogeography of plants in eastern Asia.},

	abstract = {Coptis (Ranunculaceae) contains 15 species and is one of the pharmaceutically most important plant genera in eastern Asia. Understanding of the evolution of morphological characters and phylogenetic relationships within the genus is very limited. Here, we present the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genus based on two plastid and one nuclear markers. The phylogeny was reconstructed using Bayesian inference, as well as maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. The Swofford-Olsen-Waddell-Hillis and Bayesian tests were used to assess the strength of the conflicts between traditional taxonomic units and those suggested by the phylogenetic inferences. Evolution of morphological characters was inferred using Bayesian method to identify synapomorphies for the infrageneric lineages. Our data recognize two strongly supported clades within Coptis. The first clade contains subgenus Coptis and section Japonocoptis of subgenus Metacoptis, supported by morphological characters, such as traits of the central leaflet base, petal color, and petal shape. The second clade consists of section Japonocoptis of subgenus Metacoptis. Coptis morii is not united with C. quinquefolia, in contrast with the view that C. morii is a synonym of C. quinquefolia. Two varieties of C. chinensis do not cluster together. Coptis groenlandica and C. lutescens are reduced to C. trifolia and C. japonica, respectively. Central leaflet base, sepal shape, and petal blade carry a strong phylogenetic signal in Coptis, while leaf type, sepal and petal color, and petal shape exhibit relatively higher levels of evolutionary flexibility.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Numerous studies have favored dispersal (colonization) over vicariance (past fragmentation) events to explain eastern Asian-North American distribution patterns. In plants, however the disjunction between eastern Asia and western North America has been rarely examined using the integration of phylogenetic, molecular dating, and biogeographical methods. Meanwhile, the biogeographic patterns within eastern Asia remain poorly understood. The goldthread genus Coptis Salisb. includes 15 species disjunctly distributed in North America, Japan, mainland China, and Taiwan. We present a dated phylogeny for Coptis under the optimal clock model and infer its historical biogeography by comparing different biogeographic models. RESULTS The split of Coptis and Xanthorhiza Marshall occurred in the middle Miocene (ca. 15.47 Ma). Coptis started their diversification in the early late Miocene (ca. 9.55 Ma). A late Miocene vicariance event resulted in the eastern Asian and western North American disjunction in the genus. Within eastern Asia, dispersals from mainland Asia to Japan and from Japan to Taiwan occurred at ca. 4.85 Ma and at ca. 1.34 Ma, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our analyses provide evidence that both vicariance and dispersal events have played important roles in shaping the current distribution and endemism of Coptis, likely resulting from eustatic sea-level changes, mountain formation processes and an increasing drier and cooler climate from the middle Miocene onwards.},

	abstract = {The discovery of ancient whole-genome duplications in eukaryotic lineages has renewed the interest in polyploidy and its effects on the diversification of organisms. Polyploidy has large-scale effects on both genotype and phenotype and has been linked to the evolution of genome size, dioecy, and changes in ecological interactions, such as pollinator visitation. Here, we take a molecular systematics approach to examine the evolution of polyploidy in the plant genus Thalictrum (Ranunculaceae) and test its correlation to changes in genome size, sexual system, and pollination mode. Thalictrum is an ideal study system due to its extensive ploidy range and floral diversity. Phylogenetic analyses were used for character reconstructions, correlation tests, and dating estimates. Our results suggest that polyploidization occurred frequently and recently in the evolution of Thalictrum, mostly within the last 10.6-5.8 My, coinciding with the diversification of particular clades. In spite of an overall trend of genomic downsizing accompanying polyploidy in angiosperms and proportional increases observed at finer scales, our genome size estimates for Thalictrum show no correlation with chromosome number. Instead, we observe genomic expansion in diploids and genomic contraction in polyploids with increased age. Additionally, polyploidy is not correlated with dioecy in Thalictrum; therefore, other factors must have influenced the evolution of separate sexes in this group. A novel finding from our study is the association of polyploidy with shifts to wind pollination, in particular, during a time period of global cooling and mountain uplift in the Americas.},

Wind pollination is often associated with unisexual flowers, but which evolved first and played a causative role in the evolution of the other is unclear. Thalictrum, meadow-rues (Ranunculaceae), provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of these traits because it contains insect and wind pollination and four sexual systems. We used a phylogenetic approach to reconstruct ancestral states for sexual system, pollination mode, and geographic distribution in Thalictrum, and tested for correlations to uncover the factors involved in the evolution of unisexuality and wind pollination. Our results show that dioecy, andro- and gynomonoecy evolved at least twice from hermaphroditism. Wind pollination, unisexual flowers, and New World distribution were all significantly correlated. Wind pollination may have evolved early in the genus, followed by multiple losses and gains, and likely preceded the origin of unisexual flowers in several cases; we found no evidence for unisexual flowers evolving prior to wind pollination. Given a broad scale study showing the evolution of dioecy before wind pollination, our results from a finer scale analysis highlight that different evolutionary pathways are likely to occur throughout angiosperms.},

	abstract = {The ancestry, phylogenetic differentiation and systematic classification of the worldwide-distributed genus Anemone have been debated for many years. In this paper 11 Anemone, three Pulsatilla species and Hepatica nobilis were subjected to detailed karyotype analysis with the aim of obtaining new cytogenetic data that will contribute to karyotype evolutionary studies of the tribe Anemoninae. The results are interpreted in a phylogenetic context, established from the intergenic nontranscribed spacer (NTS) of 5S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of 35S rDNA. One to three 35S and one to three 5S rDNA loci are present in diploid and polyploid taxa. The 35S rDNA loci are located terminally on the short arm of acrocentric chromosomes, while for 5S rDNA there is no preferential chromosomal position as it exhibits terminal, subterminal, interstitial or pericentromeric positions, and is located either on acrocentric or metacentric chromosomes. The karyotype of hexaploid A. baldensis (2n = 6x = 48) is presented for the first time, and A. sylvestris is proposed as one of its putative parental species. Chromosome fusion/translocation is proposed as the key mechanism involved in reduction of the basic chromosome number from 8 in the Anemone subgenus to 7 in the Anemonidium subgenus. The cytogenetic data obtained are mainly supported by ITS and NTS phylogeny. Diversification of the genus Anemone was accompanied by a large reduction of heterochromatin, from the Mediterranean anemones that have large amounts of heterochromatin to the New World anemones without any detectable heterochromatic blocks.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Ranunculaceae presents both ancestral and derived floral traits for eudicots, and as such is of potential interest to understand key steps involved in the evolution of zygomorphy in eudicots. Zygomorphy evolved once in Ranunculaceae, in the speciose and derived tribe Delphinieae. This tribe consists of two genera (Aconitum and Delphinium s.l.) comprising more than one-quarter of the species of the family. In this paper, the establishment of zygomorphy during development was investigated to cast light on the origin and evolution of this morphological novelty. METHODS; The floral developmental sequence of six species of Ranunculaceae, three actinomorphic (Nigella damascena, Aquilegia alpina and Clematis recta) and three zygomorphic (Aconitum napellus, Delphinium staphisagria and D. grandiflorum), was compared. A developmental model was elaborated to break down the successive acquisitions of floral organ identities on the ontogenic spiral (all the species studied except Aquilegia have a spiral phyllotaxis), giving clues to understanding this complex morphogenesis from an evo-devo point of view. In addition, the evolution of symmetry in Ranunculaceae was examined in conjunction with other traits of flowers and with ecological factors. KEY RESULTS In the species studied, zygomorphy is established after organogenesis is completed, and is late, compared with other zygomorphic eudicot species. Zygomorphy occurs in flowers characterized by a fixed merism and a partially reduced and transformed corolla. CONCLUSIONS It is suggested that shifts in expression of genes controlling the merism, as well as floral symmetry and organ identity, have played a critical role in the evolution of zygomorphy in Delphinieae, while the presence of pollinators able to exploit the peculiar morphology of the flower has been a key factor for the maintenance and diversification of this trait.},

Maximum likelihood analyses of 2088 aligned nucleotides of plastid and nuclear sequences obtained from up to 185 species of Delphinieae from throughout the geographic range (plus relevant outgroups) show that three short-lived (facultative annual or biennial) Mediterranean species belonging to Delphinium subgenus Staphisagria are the sister clade to all other Delphinieae, implying that Staphisagria needs to be raised to genus status if Delphinium and Aconitum are to become mutually monophyletic. Molecular clock dating suggests an origin of the sampled Delphinieae in the Early Oligocene (c. 32.3 Ma) and expansion to North America of Aconitum and Delphinium around 3.3 and 2.9 Ma ago, respectively; the East African Mts. were reached by long-distance dispersal some 2.4 Ma ago, coincident with the major uplift of the East African Rift system. The ancestral growth form of the Delphinieae could not be reconstructed, but Late Miocene bursts in diversification rates in the Himalayan and southwestern Chinese clades of Aconitum and Delphinium appear to be associated with transitions from short-lived to long-lived life histories.},

Pallasiantha, subg. Coptidium, subg. Crymodes p.p., Halerpestes, Peltocalathos, Callianthemoides, and Arcteranthis. Within the core clade, 19 clades can be described with morphological and karyological features. Several sections are not monophyletic. Parallel evolution of morphological characters in adaptation to climatic conditions may be a reason for incongruence of molecular data and morphology-based classifications. In some mountainous regions, groups of closely related species may have originated from adaptive radiation and rapid speciation. Split decomposition analysis indicated complex patterns of relationship and suggested hybridization in the apomictic R. auricomus complex, R. subg. Batrachium, and the white-flowering European alpines. The evolutionary success of the genus might be due to a combination of morphological plasticity and adaptations, hybridization and polyploidy as important factors for regional diversification, and a broad range of reproductive strategies.},

Lycoctonum (Ranunculaceae) and reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships within the subgenus. The subgenus as currently circumscribed is revealed to be polyphyletic. To achieve its monophyly, sect. Galeata and sect. Fletcherum, both being unispecific and each having a unique array of characters (the latter even having the aberrant base chromosome number of x = 6), must be removed from the subgenus. The subgenus Lycoctonum should thus be redefined to include only two sections, the unispecific sect. Alatospermum and the relatively species-rich sect. Lycoctonum. The section Alatospermum, which is both morphologically and karyologically in the primitive condition, is resolved as the first diverging lineage of the subgenus Lycoctonum clade. The monophyly of sect. Lycoctonum is strongly supported, but all the ten series currently recognized within the section are revealed to be para- or poly-phyletic. Five major clades are recovered within the section. We propose to treat them as five series: ser. Crassiflora, ser. Scaposa, ser. Volubilia, ser. Longicassidata, and ser. Lycoctonia. Thus, a formal reclassification of subgen. Lycoctonum is presented, which involves segregating both sect. Galeata and sect. Fletcherum from the subgenus as two independent subgenera within the genus Aconitum, reinstating one series (ser. Crassiflora) and abolishing six series (ser. Laevia, ser. Longibracteolata, ser. Micrantha, ser. Ranunculoidea, ser. Reclinata, and ser. Umbrosa) within sect. Lycoctonum. The series affiliation of some species within the section is adjusted accordingly.},

	abstract = {The arctic biome is a relatively young ecosystem with {\textasciitilde}2300 species of vascular plants. We studied the genus Ranunculus as an example of the origin and evolution of the arctic flora. For this purpose we used molecular phylogenetic and clock analyses based on evaluation of nuclear ITS and chloroplast matK-trnK DNA sequences in 194 taxa of Ranunculus and closely related genera. Taxa occurring in the Arctic arose form seven phylogenetic lineages of Ranunculus and also in the genera Coptidium and Halerpestes. Two clades of Ranunculus are species-rich in the Arctic, i.e., Ranunculus sect. Ranunculus and R. sect. Auricomus (both from R. subg. Ranunculus), but this is due to a number of arctic "microtaxa" morphologically barely separate from R. acris in the former clade and the widely agamospermic species complex of R. auricomus in the latter. Lineages with species adapted to wetlands or aquatic habitats are significant groups represented in the arctic flora (R. subg. Ranunculus sectt. Flammula and Hecatonia/Xanthobatrachium, R. subg. Batrachium, genus Coptidium) but show no clear signs of radiation in the Arctic or the northern boreal zone, except for sectt. Hecatonia/Xanthobatrachium, with R. hyperboreus and R. sceleratus subsp. reptabundus. Astonishingly few of the otherwise numerous lineages of Ranunculus with distributions in the higher mountain systems of Eurasia and North America have acted as "founding sources" for the arctic flora. The only clear example is that of the arctic-alpine R. glacialis and the Beringian R. chamissonis from the lineage of subg. R. sectt. Aconitifolii/Crymodes, although there might be others in sect. Auricomus not recovered in the current molecular data. Lineages that gave rise to arctic taxa diverged from each other from the early Miocene (R. glacialis/R. chamissonis, Coptidium, lineages in Halerpestes) and continued at an even rate throughout the Tertiary. There are no signs that the intense climate changes of the late Pliocene and the Quaternary substantially accelerated or impeded diversification in Ranunculus. Only the crown group split of R. acris and its relatives is clearly of Quaternary age. A detailed comparison concerning morphology, karyology, and life form excludes fundamental differences between taxa of Ranunculus in the Arctic and their respective closest relatives in regions south of it. Ecological traits, e.g., preferences for dry or moist soils or growth in open and sheltered conditions, also do not differ between arctic and nonarctic̣ taxa. Migration into the Arctic thus started from different phylogenetic lineages and at different times, without development of obvious special traits in the adaptation to arctic environments. This recurrent pattern in Ranunculus differs from that seen in other arctic genera, e.g., Artemisia, in which special traits of adaptation to arctic environments are found. In Ranunculus, the origin of the open arctic biome primarily favored range expansions of taxa/species already adapted to wet habitats in cold areas and depending on rapid dispersal.},

To reconstruct the biogeographical history of the genus, a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the genus based on nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences has been carried out. Results of biogeographical analyses (DIVA, Lagrange, Mesquite) combined with molecular dating suggest multiple colonizations of all continents and disjunctions between the northern and the southern hemisphere. Dispersals between continents must have occurred via migration over land bridges, or via transoceanic long-distance dispersal, which is also inferred from island endemism. In southern Eurasia, isolation of the western Mediterranean and the Caucasus region during the Messinian was followed by range expansions and speciation in both areas. In the Pliocene and Pleistocene, radiations happened independently in the summer-dry western Mediterranean-Macaronesian and in the eastern Mediterranean-Irano-Turanian regions, with three independent shifts to alpine humid climates in the Alps and in the Himalayas. The cosmopolitan distribution of Ranunculus is caused by transoceanic and intracontinental dispersal, followed by regional adaptive radiations.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-4-40},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND The phylogenetic relationships among the holoparasites of Rafflesiales have remained enigmatic for over a century. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies using the mitochondrial matR gene placed Rafflesia, Rhizanthes and Sapria (Rafflesiaceae s. str.) in the angiosperm order Malpighiales and Mitrastema (Mitrastemonaceae) in Ericales. These phylogenetic studies did not, however, sample two additional groups traditionally classified within Rafflesiales (Apodantheaceae and Cytinaceae). Here we provide molecular phylogenetic evidence using DNA sequence data from mitochondrial and nuclear genes for representatives of all genera in Rafflesiales. RESULTS Our analyses indicate that the phylogenetic affinities of the large-flowered clade and Mitrastema, ascertained using mitochondrial matR, are congruent with results from nuclear SSU rDNA when these data are analyzed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The relationship of Cytinaceae to Malvales was recovered in all analyses. Relationships between Apodanthaceae and photosynthetic angiosperms varied depending upon the data partition: Malvales (3-gene), Cucurbitales (matR) or Fabales (atp1). The latter incongruencies suggest that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) may be affecting the mitochondrial gene topologies. The lack of association between Mitrastema and Ericales using atp1 is suggestive of HGT, but greater sampling within eudicots is needed to test this hypothesis further. CONCLUSIONS Rafflesiales are not monophyletic but composed of three or four independent lineages (families): Rafflesiaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Apodanthaceae and Cytinaceae. Long-branch attraction appears to be misleading parsimony analyses of nuclear small-subunit rDNA data, but model-based methods (maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses) recover a topology that is congruent with the mitochondrial matR gene tree, thus providing compelling evidence for organismal relationships. Horizontal gene transfer appears to be influencing only some taxa and some mitochondrial genes, thus indicating that the process is acting at the single gene (not whole genome) level.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study is to elucidate the evolutionary history of the enigmatic holoparasitic Rafflesiaceae. More specifically, floral morphological evolution is interpreted in a molecular phylogenetic context, the biogeographic history of the family is investigated, and the possibility of character displacement to have been operating in this family is assessed. Parsimony and Bayesian methods are used to estimate phylogeny and divergence times among Rafflesiaceae species based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence data from Barkman et al. (2008) as well as new sequence data from additional samples and an additional genetic marker, the plastid 16S. Ancestral areas are inferred using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) as well a more recently developed parametric likelihood method (LAGRANGE), now including an update that allows for estimation over the posterior distribution of dated trees. Our extended molecular phylogeny of Rafflesiaceae implies a general lack of morphological synapomorphies as well as a high level of morphological homoplasy. In particular, a high level of floral morphological homoplasy is detected among Rafflesia species suggestive of similar patterns of pollinator-based selection in different geographic areas, and multiple instances of divergent floral size evolution is consistent with a model of character displacement. Initial diversification of Rafflesiaceae during the Late Cretaceous was followed by a long period of no-net diversification, likely due to extinctions caused by a Late Eocene to Miocene dramatic reduction in rainforest cover. A Late Miocene to Early Pliocene rise in sea-level probably caused the vicariant diversification observed between areas of endemism. The most recent species divergences are concordant with Pleistocene changes in climate and sea-levels, but apparently with no successful inter-area migrations, supportive of savannah, rather than rainforest, covered landbridges. An explosive increase in net diversification rate, most pronounced in Rafflesia, may be explained by Mid-Miocene to Pliocene rainforest-favorable conditions as well as natural selection promoting character displacement for Rafflesia flower size.},

We present a time-calibrated phylogeny that includes nearly half of extant fern diversity. Our results are evaluated in the context of previous studies and the fossil record, and we develop new hypotheses about the radiation of leptosporangiate ferns. We used sequence data from six chloroplast regions for nearly 4000 species of ferns to generate the most comprehensive phylogeny of the group ever published. We calibrate the phylogeny with twenty-six fossils and use an array of phylogenetic methods to resolve phylogenetic relationships, estimate divergence times, and infer speciation, extinction, and net diversification rates. We infer a mid-late Silurian origin for ferns (including horsetails) and an early Carboniferous origin for leptosporangiate ferns. Most derived fern families appeared in the Cretaceous and persisted for millions of years before rapidly diversifying in the Cenozoic. We find no evidence of differential rates of diversification among terrestrial and epiphytic species. Our findings challenge previous hypotheses on the evolutionary history of ferns and present a new paradigm for their Cenozoic radiation. We estimate earlier divergences for most fern lineages than were reported in previous studies and provide evidence of extended persistence of major fern lineages prior to rapid diversification in the last fifty million years.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED • PREMISE OF THE STUDY Understanding fern (monilophyte) phylogeny and its evolutionary timescale is critical for broad investigations of the evolution of land plants, and for providing the point of comparison necessary for studying the evolution of the fern sister group, seed plants. Molecular phylogenetic investigations have revolutionized our understanding of fern phylogeny, however, to date, these studies have relied almost exclusively on plastid data.• METHODS Here we take a curated phylogenomics approach to infer the first broad fern phylogeny from multiple nuclear loci, by combining broad taxon sampling (73 ferns and 12 outgroup species) with focused character sampling (25 loci comprising 35877 bp), along with rigorous alignment, orthology inference and model selection.• KEY RESULTS Our phylogeny corroborates some earlier inferences and provides novel insights; in particular, we find strong support for Equisetales as sister to the rest of ferns, Marattiales as sister to leptosporangiate ferns, and Dennstaedtiaceae as sister to the eupolypods. Our divergence-time analyses reveal that divergences among the extant fern orders all occurred prior to ∼200 MYA. Finally, our species-tree inferences are congruent with analyses of concatenated data, but generally with lower support. Those cases where species-tree support values are higher than expected involve relationships that have been supported by smaller plastid datasets, suggesting that deep coalescence may be reducing support from the concatenated nuclear data.• CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates the utility of a curated phylogenomics approach to inferring fern phylogeny, and highlights the need to consider underlying data characteristics, along with data quantity, in phylogenetic studies.},

	doi = {10.1093/sysbio/sys001},
	abstract = {Backbone relationships within the large eupolypod II clade, which includes nearly a third of extant fern species, have resisted elucidation by both molecular and morphological data. Earlier studies suggest that much of the phylogenetic intractability of this group is due to three factors: (i) a long root that reduces apparent levels of support in the ingroup; (ii) long ingroup branches subtended by a series of very short backbone internodes (the "ancient rapid radiation" model); and (iii) significantly heterogeneous lineage-specific rates of substitution. To resolve the eupolypod II phylogeny, with a particular emphasis on the backbone internodes, we assembled a data set of five plastid loci (atpA, atpB, matK, rbcL, and trnG-R) from a sample of 81 accessions selected to capture the deepest divergences in the clade. We then evaluated our phylogenetic hypothesis against potential confounding factors, including those induced by rooting, ancient rapid radiation, rate heterogeneity, and the Bayesian star-tree paradox artifact. While the strong support we inferred for the backbone relationships proved robust to these potential problems, their investigation revealed unexpected model-mediated impacts of outgroup composition, divergent effects of methods for countering the star-tree paradox artifact, and gave no support to concerns about the applicability of the unrooted model to data sets with heterogeneous lineage-specific rates of substitution. This study is among few to investigate these factors with empirical data, and the first to compare the performance of the two primary methods for overcoming the Bayesian star-tree paradox artifact. Among the significant phylogenetic results is the near-complete support along the eupolypod II backbone, the demonstrated paraphyly of Woodsiaceae as currently circumscribed, and the well-supported placement of the enigmatic genera Homalosorus, Diplaziopsis, and Woodsia.},

Investigations into their early ecological and life-history diversification require accurate, well-corroborated phylogenetic estimates. We examined the utility of a large plastid-based data set in inferring backbone relationships for monilophytes. • METHODS We recovered 17 plastid genes for exemplar taxa using published and new primers. We compared results from maximum-likelihood and parsimony analyses, assessed the effects of removing rapidly evolving characters, and examined the extent to which our data corroborate or contradict the results of other studies, or resolve current ambiguities. • KEY RESULTS Considering multifamily clades, we found bootstrap support comparable to or better than that in published studies that used fewer genes from fewer or more taxa. We firmly establish filmy ferns (Hymenophyllales) as the sister group of all leptosporangiates except Osmundaceae, resolving the second deepest split in leptosporangiate-fern phylogeny. A clade comprising Ophioglossaceae and Psilotaceae is currently accepted as the sister group of other monilophytes, but we recover Equisetum in this position. We also recover marattioid and leptosporangiate ferns as sister groups. Maximum-likelihood rate-class estimates are somewhat skewed when a long-branch lineage (Selaginella) is included, negatively affecting bootstrap support for early branches. • CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the utility of this gene set in corroborating relationships found in previous studies, improving support, and resolving uncertainties in monilophyte phylogeny. Despite these advances, our results also underline the need for continued work on resolving the very earliest splits in monilophyte phylogeny.},

Parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses provided a mostly congruent results and in general supported the prevailing view on the higher-level fern systematics. At a deep phylogenetic level, the position of horsetails depended on the optimality criteria chosen, with horsetails positioned as the sister group either of Marattiopsida-Polypodiopsida clade or of the Polypodiopsida. The analyses demonstrate the power of using a 'supermatrix' approach to resolve large-scale phylogenies and reveal questionable taxonomies.

However, the use of matK in fern phylogeny is largely unknown, due to difficulties with amplification: ferns have lost the flanking trnK exons, typically the region used for designing stable priming sites. We developed primers that are either universal or lineage-specific that successfully amplify matK across all fern families. To evaluate whether matK is as powerful a phylogenetic marker in ferns as in angiosperms, we compared its sequence characteristics and phylogenetic performance to those of rbcL and atpA. Among these three genes, matK has the highest variability and substitution evenness, yet shows the least homoplasy. Most importantly, applying matK in fern phylogenetics better resolved relationships among families, especially within eupolypods I and II. Here we demonstrate the power of matK for fern phylogenetic reconstruction, as well as provide primers and extensive sequence data that will greatly facilitate future evolutionary studies of ferns.},

	abstract = {The "Monilophyte" clade comprising ferns, horsetails and whisk ferns receives unequivocal support from molecular data as the sister clade to seed plants. However, the branching order of its earliest emerging lineages, the Equisetales (horsetails), the Marattiales, the Ophioglossales/Psilotales and the large group of leptosporangiate ferns has remained dubious. We investigated the mitochondrial nad2 and rpl2 genes as two new, intron-containing loci for a wide sampling of taxa. We found that both group II introns - nad2i542g2 and rpl2i846g2 - are universally present among monilophytes. Both introns have orthologues in seed plants where nad2i542g2 has evolved into a trans-arrangement. In contrast and despite substantial size extensions to more than 5kb in Psilotum, nad2i542g2 remains cis-arranged in the monilophytes. For phylogenetic analyses, we filled taxonomic gaps in previously investigated mitochondrial (atp1, nad5) and chloroplast (atpA, atpB, matK, rbcL, rps4) loci and created a 9-gene matrix that also included the new mitochondrial nad2 and rpl2 loci. We extended the taxon sampling with two taxa each for all land plant outgroups (liverworts, mosses, hornworts, lycophytes and seed plants) to minimize the risk of phylogenetic artefacts. We ultimately obtained a well-supported molecular phylogeny placing Marattiales as sister to leptosporangiate ferns and horsetails as sister to all remaining monilophytes. In addition, an indel in an exon of the here introduced rpl2 locus independently supports the placement of horsetails. We conclude that under dense taxon sampling, phylogenetic information from a prudent choice of loci is currently superior to character-rich phylogenomic approaches at low taxon sampling. As here shown the selective choice of loci and taxa enabled us to resolve the long-enigmatic diversifications of the earliest monilophyte lineages.},

The subfamily Pteridoideae is one of the five subfamilies often recognized. The circumscription of Pteridoideae has not been clear. A large number of species have not yet been included in any molecular analyses before. In this study, DNA sequences of six plastid loci of 154 accessions representing ca. 87 species in 14 genera of Pteridaceae subfam. Pteridoideae and four accessions representing two species in subfam. Parkerioideae and one species of subfam. Adiantoideae as outgroups were used to infer a phylogeny using maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Our analyses show that (1) Pteridoideae is monophyletic and the newly defined subfamily is composed of 14 genera including a newly described genus; (2) Pteridoideae is resolved into four strongly supported monophyletic clades: the Pteris clade, the Actiniopteris+Onychium clade, the JAPSTT clade, and the GAPCC clade, these being supported by not only molecular data but also morphological features and distribution information; (3) Onychium is confirmed as monophyletic and accessions of Onychium are resolved into two strongly supported clades, the O. cryptogrammoides clade and the O. siliculosum clade; and (4) Accessions of the traditionally defined Anogramma are resolved as paraphyletic in relation to Cerosora, Cosentinica, and Pityrogramma. Three species traditionally treated in Anogramma are in fact more closely related to Cerosora and Pityrogramma than they are to Anogramma. Gastoniella Li Bing Zhang \& Liang Zhang, gen. nov. is described to accommodate these species and three new combinations are provided. Three currently known species of Gastoniella are distributed in the Ascension Island in South Atlantic Ocean, central Mexico, and tropical America, respectively.

In this study, we present the results of the first broad-scale and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses of these ferns, and determine the affinities of several previously unsampled genera. Our analyses of two newly assembled data sets (including 169 newly obtained sequences) resolve five major clades within the Pteridaceae: cryptogrammoids, ceratopteridoids, pteridoids, adiantoids, and cheilanthoids. Although the composition of these clades is in general agreement with earlier phylogenetic studies, it is very much at odds with the most recent subfamilial classification. Of the previously unsampled genera, two (Neurocallis and Ochropteris) are nested within the genus Pteris; two others (Monogramma and Rheopteris) are early diverging vittarioid ferns, with Monogramma resolved as polyphyletic; the last previously unsampled genus (Adiantopsis) occupies a rather derived position among cheilanthoids. Interestingly, some clades resolved within the Pteridaceae can be characterized by their ecological preferences, suggesting that the initial diversification in this family was tied to ecological innovation and specialization. These processes may well be the basis for the diversity and success of the Pteridaceae today.},

	volume = {63},
	doi = {10.1093/sysbio/syt058},
	abstract = {Molecular evolutionary rate heterogeneity-the violation of a molecular clock-is a prominent feature of many phylogenetic data sets. It has particular importance to systematists not only because of its biological implications, but also for its practical effects on our ability to infer and date evolutionary events. Here we show, using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches, that a remarkably strong increase in substitution rate in the vittarioid ferns is consistent across the nuclear and plastid genomes. Contrary to some expectations, this rate increase is not due to selective forces acting at the protein level on our focal loci. The vittarioids bear no signature of the change in the relative strengths of selection and drift that one would expect if the rate increase was caused by altered post-mutation fixation rates. Instead, the substitution rate increase appears to stem from an elevated supply of mutations, perhaps limited to the vittarioid ancestral branch. This generalized rate increase is accompanied by extensive fine-scale heterogeneity in rates across loci, genomes, and taxa. Our analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of trait-free investigations of rate heterogeneity within a model-selection framework, emphasize the importance of explicit tests for signatures of selection prior to invoking selection-related or demography-based explanations for patterns of rate variation, and illustrate some unexpected nuances in the behavior of relaxed clock methods for modeling rate heterogeneity, with implications for our ability to confidently date divergence events. In addition, our data provide strong support for the monophyly of Adiantum, and for the position of Calciphilopteris in the cheilanthoid ferns, two relationships for which convincing support was previously lacking.},

Confounding the clarity of reconstructing the evolutionary history of Adiantum is that previous molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that a separate and distinctive clade, the vittarioids, may be derived from within Adiantum. Five plastid markers (atpA, atpB, rbcL, trnL-F and rps4-trnS) are employed to assess the monophyly of Adiantum, and construct the molecular phylogeny of Chinese Adiantum. Our analyses support the monophyly of Adiantum. All temperate Adiantum species form a clade nested within the pantropical grade, suggesting a tropical origin of Adiantum. Six main clades are supported within Chinese Adiantum, which are only partially consistent with Lin's classification of the genus. Series Caudata is polyphyletic with series Gravesiana nested within one subgroup of series Caudata. The prolonged whip-like stolon at the apex of the fronds is the defining character for series Caudata, but it may have evolved multiple times. Adiantum reniforme with the simple fronds is sister to series Venusta, which has a decompound lamina with many flabellate to cuneate segments. Series Veneri-capilliformia is not monophyletic, with A. capillus-veneris sister to series Flabellulata except for A. diaphanum, and A. edentulum sister to series Pedata. Series Flabellulata is biphyletic with A. diaphanum nested within the pantropical grade. The phylogeny suggests that convergent evolution in frond architecture has occurred in Adiantum.},

In this study of cheilanthoid ferns, we demonstrate increased resolving power for clarifying the origins of polyploid lineages by integrating evidence from a diverse selection of biosystematic methods. The prevalence of polyploidy, hybridization, and apomixis in ferns suggests that these processes play a significant role in their evolution and diversification. Using a combination of systematic approaches, we investigated the origins of apomictic polyploids belonging to the Cheilanthes yavapensis complex. Spore studies allowed us to assess ploidy levels; plastid and nuclear DNA sequencing revealed evolutionary relationships and confirmed the putative progenitors (both maternal and paternal) of taxa of hybrid origin; enzyme electrophoretic evidence provided information on genome dosage in allopolyploids. We find here that the widespread apomictic triploid, Cheilanthes lindheimeri, is an autopolyploid derived from a rare, previously undetected sexual diploid. The apomictic triploid Cheilanthes wootonii is shown to be an interspecific hybrid between C. fendleri and C. lindheimeri, whereas the apomictic tetraploid C. yavapensis is comprised of two cryptic and geographically distinct lineages. We show that earlier morphology-based hypotheses of species relationships, while not altogether incorrect, only partially explain the complicated evolutionary history of these ferns.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Pteris (Pteridaceae), comprising over 250 species, had been thought to be a monophyletic genus until the three monotypic genera Neurocallis, Ochropteris and Platyzoma were included. However, the relationships between the type species of the genus Pteris, P. longifolia, and other species are still unknown. Furthermore, several infrageneric morphological classifications have been proposed, but are debated. To date, no worldwide phylogenetic hypothesis has been proposed for the genus, and no comprehensive biogeographical history of Pteris, crucial to understanding its cosmopolitan distribution, has been presented. METHODS A molecular phylogeny of Pteris is presented for 135 species, based on cpDNA rbcL and matK and using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference approaches. The inferred phylogeny was used to assess the biogeographical history of Pteris and to reconstruct the evolution of one ecological and four morphological characters commonly used for infrageneric classifications. KEY RESULTS The monophyly of Pteris remains uncertain, especially regarding the relationship of Pteris with Actiniopteris + Onychium and Platyzoma. Pteris comprises 11 clades supported by combinations of ecological and morphological character states, but none of the characters used in previous classifications were found to be exclusive synapomorphies. The results indicate that Pteris diversified around 47 million years ago, and when species colonized new geographical areas they generated new lineages, which are associated with morphological character transitions. CONCLUSIONS This first phylogeny of Pteris on a global scale and including more than half of the diversity of the genus should contribute to a new, more reliable infrageneric classification of Pteris, based not only on a few morphological characters but also on ecological traits and geographical distribution. The inferred biogeographical history highlights long-distance dispersal as a major process shaping the worldwide distribution of the species. Colonization of different niches was followed by subsequent morphological diversification. Dispersal events followed by allopatric and parapatric speciation contribute to the species diversity of Pteris.},

Using analyses that controlled for relatedness among Leucadendron species, we investigated how these transitions shaped the evolution of floral structural and signaling traits, including the degree of sexual dimorphism in these traits. Pollen grains of wind-pollinated species were found to be smaller, more numerous, and dispersed more efficiently in wind than were those of insect-pollinated species. Wind-pollinated species also exhibited a reduction in spectral contrast between showy subtending leaves and background foliage, reduced volatile emissions, and a greater degree of sexual dimorphism in color and scent. Uniovulate flowers and inflorescence condensation are conserved ancestral features in Leucadendron and likely served as exaptations in shifts to wind pollination.

The use of a number of independent genes is required to resolve phylogenetic relationships, especially for groups displaying low polymorphism. In such cases, low-copy nuclear exons and non-coding regions, such as 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) or introns, constitute a potentially interesting source of nuclear DNA variation. Here, we present a methodology meant to identify new nuclear orthologous markers using both public-nucleotide databases and transcriptomic data generated for the group of interest by using next generation sequencing technology. To identify PCR primers for a non-model group, the genus Leucadendron (Proteaceae), we adopted a framework aimed at minimizing the probability of paralogy and maximizing polymorphism. We anchored when possible the right-hand primer into the 3'-UTR and the left-hand primer into the coding region. Seven new nuclear markers emerged from this search strategy, three of those included 3'-UTRs. We further compared the phylogenetic potential between our new markers and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS). The sequenced 3'-UTRs yielded higher polymorphism rates than the ITS region did. We did not find strong incongruences with the phylogenetic signal contained in the ITS region and the seven new designed markers but they strongly improved the phylogeny of the genus Leucadendron. Overall, this methodology is efficient in isolating orthologous loci and is valid for any non-model group given the availability of transcriptomic data.},

We reconstructed a new molecular phylogeny of this highly diverse genus that involves more taxa and molecular markers than previously. This reconstruction identifies new clades that were not detected by previous molecular study and morphological classifications. Using this new phylogeny and robust methods that account for phylogenetic uncertainty, we show that the five life-history traits studied were labile during the evolutionary history of the genus.

We found that species with longer seed-dispersal distances tended to evolve lower pollen-dispersal distance, that insect-pollinated species evolved decreased sexual dimorphism, and that species with a persistent soil seed-bank evolved toward reduced fire-survival ability of adults.},

The genus Protea belongs to a lineage that may have been in Africa since the Late Cretaceous but began to diversify in the Cape only 5-18 Myr ago.

	abstract = {The Proteaceae is a large angiosperm family displaying the common pattern of uneven distribution of species among genera. Previous studies have shown that this disparity is a result of variation in diversification rates across lineages, but the reasons for this variation are still unclear. Here, we tested the impact of floral symmetry and occurrence in Mediterranean climate regions on speciation and extinction rates in the Proteaceae. A rate shift analysis was conducted on dated genus-level phylogenetic trees of the Proteaceae. Character-dependent analyses were used to test for differences in diversification rates between actinomorphic and zygomorphic lineages and between lineages located within or outside Mediterranean climate regions. The rate shift analysis identified 5-10 major diversification rate shifts in the Proteaceae tree. The character-dependent analyses showed that speciation rates, extinction rates and net diversification rates of the Proteaceae were significantly higher for lineages occurring in Mediterranean hotspots. Higher speciation and extinction rates were also detected for zygomorphic species, but net diversification rates appeared to be similar in actinomorphic and zygomorphic Proteaceae. Presence in Mediterranean hotspots favors Proteaceae diversification. In contrast with observations at the scale of angiosperms, floral symmetry is not a trait that strongly influences their evolutionary success.},

Macadamia is cultivated outside its natural range as a "nut" crop (notably in Hawaii, where it is the principal orchard crop). We sampled seven DNA regions and 53 morphological characters from the tribe to infer its phylogeny and address the common assumption that the distribution of the extant diversity of the tribe arose by the rafting of ancestors on Gondwanan fragments. Macadamia proves to be paraphyletic with respect to the African genus Brabejum, the South American genus Panopsis, and the Australian species Orites megacarpus. We erect two new generic names, Nothorites and Lasjia, to produce monophyly at that rank. The earliest disjunctions in the tribe are inferred to be the result of long-distance dispersal out of Australia (with one possible exception), rather than vicariance. Evolution of tardy fruit dehiscence is correlated with these dispersals, and the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) precedes them. We suggest that the ancestors of extant diversity arrived on their respective continents via the ACC, and we recognize that this is a mechanism precluded, rather than facilitated, by Gondwana's terrestrial continuity.},

It contains Grevillea-the third largest plant genus in Australia and a group inferred to have among the highest diversification rates in the angiosperms. However, we lack a robust phylogenetic framework for understanding subtribe Hakeinae and recognize that Grevillea lacks an unambiguous synapomorphy supporting its monophyly. METHODS We used four plastid and one nuclear DNA region from a taxonomically even sampling of a third of the species to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny of Hakeinae and absolute diversification rates of major clades. We developed the R package addTaxa to add unsampled taxa to the tree for diversification rate inference. KEY RESULTS Grevillea is paraphyletic with respect to Hakea and Finschia. Under most parameter combinations, Hakea contains the major clade with the highest diversification rate in Hakeinae, rather than Grevillea. The crown age of the Grevillea+Hakea+Finschia crown group is about double that of prior estimates. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that the paraphyly of Grevillea considerably enlarges the number of Australian descendants from its most recent common ancestor but has also misled investigators who considered a single operational taxonomic unit as adequate to represent the genus for inferences of diversification rate and timing. Our time-calibrated phylogeny can form the basis of future evolutionary, comparative ecology, and biogeography studies involving this large Australian plant radiation, as well as nomenclatural changes.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY A past study based on morphological data alone showed that the means by which plants of the Australian genus Hakea reduce florivory is related to the evolution of bird pollination. For example, bird pollination was shown to have arisen only in insect-pollinated lineages that already produced greater amounts of floral cyanide, a feature that reduces florivory. We examine a central conclusion of that study, and a common assumption in the literature, that bird pollination arose in insect-pollinated lineages, rather than the reverse. METHODS We combined morphological and DNA data to infer the phylogeny and age of the Australian genus Hakea, using 9.2 kilobases of plastid and nuclear DNA and 46 morphological characters from a taxonomically even sampling of 55 of the 149 species. KEY RESULTS Hakea is rooted confidently in a position that has not been suggested before. The phylogeny implies that bird pollination is primitive in Hakea and that multiple shifts to insect pollination have occurred. The unexpectedly young age of Hakea (a crown age of ca. 10 Ma) makes it coincident with its primary bird pollinators (honeyeaters) throughout its history. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that Hakea is an exception to the more commonly described shift from insect to bird pollination. However, we note that only one previous phylogenetic study involved Australian plants and their honeyeater pollinators and that our finding might prove to be more common on that continent.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Many factors have been identified as correlates of the rate of molecular evolution, such as body size and generation length. Analysis of many molecular phylogenies has also revealed correlations between substitution rates and clade size, suggesting a link between rates of molecular evolution and the process of diversification. However, it is not known whether this relationship applies to all lineages and all sequences. Here, in order to investigate how widespread this phenomenon is, we investigate patterns of substitution in chloroplast genomes of the diverse angiosperm family Proteaceae. We used DNA sequences from six chloroplast genes (6278bp alignment with 62 taxa) to test for a correlation between diversification and the rate of substitutions. RESULTS Using phylogenetically-independent sister pairs, we show that species-rich lineages of Proteaceae tend to have significantly higher chloroplast substitution rates, for both synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. CONCLUSIONS We show that the rate of molecular evolution in chloroplast genomes is correlated with net diversification rates in this large plant family. We discuss the possible causes of this relationship, including molecular evolution driving diversification, speciation increasing the rate of substitutions, or a third factor causing an indirect link between molecular and diversification rates. The link between the synonymous substitution rate and clade size is consistent with a role for the mutation rate of chloroplasts driving the speed of reproductive isolation. We find no significant differences in the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions between lineages differing in net diversification rate, therefore we detect no signal of population size changes or alteration in selection pressures that might be causing this relationship.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Hotspots of angiosperm species richness and endemism in Mediterranean-climate regions are among the most striking, but least well-understood, geographic patterns of biodiversity. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of rapid diversification within hotspots, compared to non-hotspot regions, as a major contributor to these patterns. We constructed the first near-complete phylogeny of Banksia (Proteaceae) to test whether diversification rates have differed between lineages confined to the southwest Australian hotspot and those found throughout southern, eastern and northern Australia. We then tested for variation in diversification rates among the bioclimatic zones within the southwest hotspot itself. RESULTS Although Banksia species richness in the southwest is ten times that of the rest of the continent, we find little evidence for more rapid diversification in the southwest, although this result is inconclusive. However, we find firmer support for substantial rate variation within the southwest hotspot, with more rapid diversification in the semi-arid heaths and shrublands, compared to the high-rainfall forests. Most of the Banksia diversity of the southwest appears to be generated in the heaths and shrublands, with a high migration rate out of this zone boosting diversity of the adjacent forest zone. CONCLUSIONS The geographic pattern of diversification in Banksia appears more complex than can be characterized by a simple hotspot vs. non-hotspot comparison, but in general, these findings contrast with the view that the high diversity of Mediterranean hotspots is underpinned by rapid radiations. Steady accumulation of species at unexceptional rates, but over long periods of time, may also have contributed substantially to the great botanical richness of these regions.},

The genus is unusual in being dioecious and sexually dimorphic. ITS sequence data were obtained from 62 of the 96 currently recognized taxa (85 species and 11 subspecies). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted under Maximum Likelihood and parsimony and resolved nine groups of species with varying degrees of bootstrap support, but relationships between these groups are largely unsupported. The phylogeny conflicts with the current taxonomic arrangement, which is based mainly on fruit morphology. The two sections of the genus, Alatosperma and Leucadendron, and several subsections within these sections, are resolved as non-monophyletic. This means that taxonomically important characters (such as fruit shape) have evolved multiple times, as the species with nut-like fruit (resolved into two of the nine groups) appear to have evolved independently from ancestors with winged fruit. Based on the topology obtained, the life history traits of anemophily, myrmechochory, and re-sprouting have also originated multiple times. Dispersal-Vicariance (DIVA) analysis suggests that the genus had an ancestral area in the Karoo Mountain and Southeastern phytogeographic centres of endemism in the southwestern Cape.},

Although its species are popular ornamentals, traditional medicinal plants and model organisms for the study of heterostyly, the section has not yet been studied from a phylogenetic or evolutionary perspective. Using phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ITS and plastid data from all species and subspecies, we find that widespread Primula elatior is genetically heterogeneous and non-monophyletic to most if not all of the other ingroup taxa. The Genealogical Sorting Index (GSI) indicates that the assumption of all currently accepted species being independent lineages is consistent with the data. It is possible that P. elatior in its current circumscription may represents the disjointed remnant of an ancestral species from which the other recognized species diverged. However, based on available data, the alternative possibility of introgression explaining the non-monophyly of this species cannot be excluded. Species trees show P. elatior and P. veris as sister species. Primula vulgaris and P. juliae are closely related, while, in contrast to previous assumptions, P. renifolia does not appear to be a close relative of P. megaseifolia. With the section's isolation from the rest of the genus and very short internal branches, our dataset also presents a case study of the confounding effects of different branch length priors on the Bayesian estimation of resulting branch length estimates. Experimental runs using different priors confirm the problem of resulting estimates varying by orders of magnitude, while topology and relative branch lengths seem unaffected.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The historical orogenesis and associated climatic changes of mountain areas have been suggested to partly account for the occurrence of high levels of biodiversity and endemism. However, their effects on dispersal, differentiation and evolution of many groups of plants are still unknown. In this study, we examined the detailed diversification history of Primula sect. Armerina, and used biogeographic analysis and macro-evolutionary modeling to investigate a series of different questions concerning the evolution of the geographical and ecological distribution of the species in this section. RESULTS We sequenced five chloroplast and one nuclear genes for species of Primula sect. Armerina. Neither chloroplast nor nuclear trees support the monophyly of the section. The major incongruences between the two trees occur among closely related species and may be explained by hybridization. Our dating analyses based on the chloroplast dataset suggest that this section began to diverge from its relatives around 3.55 million years ago, largely coinciding with the last major uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Biogeographic analysis supports the origin of the section in the Himalayan Mountains and dispersal from the Himalayas to Northeastern QTP, Western QTP and Hengduan Mountains. Furthermore, evolutionary models of ecological niches show that the two P. fasciculata clades have significantly different climatic niche optima and rates of niche evolution, indicating niche evolution under climatic changes and further providing evidence for explaining their biogeographic patterns. CONCLUSION Our results support the hypothesis that geologic and climatic events play important roles in driving biological diversification of organisms in the QTP area. The Pliocene uplift of the QTP and following climatic changes most likely promoted both the inter- and intraspecific divergence of Primula sect. Armerina. This study also illustrates how niche evolution under climatic changes influences biogeographic patterns.},

	doi = {10.1093/sysbio/syp010},
	abstract = {Although polyploidy plays a fundamental role in plant evolution, the elucidation of polyploid origins is fraught with methodological challenges. For example, allopolyploid species may confound phylogenetic reconstruction because commonly used methods are designed to trace divergent, rather than reticulate patterns. Recently developed techniques of phylogenetic network estimation allow for a more effective identification of incongruence among trees. However, incongruence can also be caused by incomplete lineage sorting, paralogy, concerted evolution, and recombination. Thus, initial hypotheses of hybridization need to be examined via additional sources of evidence, including the partitioning of infraspecific genetic polymorphisms, morphological characteristics, chromosome numbers, crossing experiments, and distributional patterns. Primula sect. Aleuritia subsect. Aleuritia (Aleuritia) represents an ideal case study to examine reticulation because specific hypotheses have been derived from morphology, karyology, interfertility, and distribution to explain the observed variation of ploidy levels, ranging from diploidy to 14-ploidy. Sequences from 5 chloroplast and 1 nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) markers were analyzed to generate the respective phylogenies and consensus networks. Furthermore, extensive cloning of the nrDNA marker allowed for the identification of shared nucleotides at polymorphic sites, investigation of infraspecific genetic polymorphisms via principal coordinate analyses PCoAs, and detection of recombination between putative progenitor sequences. The results suggest that most surveyed polyploids originated via hybridization and that 2 taxonomic species formed recurrently from different progenitors, findings that are congruent with the expectations of speciation via secondary contact. Overall, the study highlights the importance of using multiple experimental and analytical approaches to disentangle complex patterns of reticulation.},

Using robust methods that account for phylogenetic uncertainty, intraspecific variability of climatic requirements and different life-history evolution scenarios, we show that climatic niches of Androsace s.l. exhibit low phylogenetic signal and that they evolved relatively recently and punctually. Models of niche evolution fitted onto phylogenies show that the cushion life form has been a key innovation providing the opportunity to occupy extremely cold environments, thus contributing to rapid climatic niche diversification in the genus Androsace s.l.

However, the frequent lack of phylogenetic resolution in species-rich alpine plant groups hampers progress towards clarifying the causes of diversification in mountains. In this study, we use the largest plant group endemic to the European Alpine system, Primula sect. Auricula, as a model system. We employ a newly developed next-generation-sequencing protocol, involving sequence capture with RAD probes, and map reads to the reference genome of Primula veris to obtain DNA matrices with thousands of SNPs. We use these data-rich matrices to infer phylogenetic relationships in Primula sect. Auricula and examine species delimitations in two taxonomically difficult subgroups: the clades formed by the close relatives of P. auricula and P. pedemontana, respectively. Our molecular dataset enables us to resolve most phylogenetic relationships in the group with strong support, and in particular to infer four well-supported clades within sect. Auricula. Our results support existing species delimitations for P. auricula, P. lutea, and P. subpyrenaica, while they suggest that the group formed by P. pedemontana and close relatives might need taxonomic revision. Finally, we discuss preliminary implications of these findings on the biogeographic history of Primula sect. Auricula.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The populations of Soldanella (Primulaceae) of the southern Apennines (Italy) are unique within the genus for their distribution and ecology. Their highly fragmented distribution range, with three main metapopulations on some of the highest mountains (Gelbison, Sila and Aspromonte massifs) of the area, poses intriguing questions about their evolutionary history and biogeography, and about the possibility of local endemisms. AIMS AND METHODS In order to clarify the phylogeny and biogeography of the three metapopulations of Soldanella in the southern Apennines, attributed to S. calabrella to date, and to identify possible local endemisms, a comparative approach based on the study of molecular, morphological and ecological characteristics of the populations was employed. Specifically, one nuclear (total ITS) and two plastid (rbcL and trnL) markers were used for the phylogenetic analyses, performed through both maximum likelihood and Bayesian techniques. Among the morphological features, the glandular hair and leaf biometric traits were analysed, and the environment in which the populations grew was characterised for altitude, forest canopy composition and soil pH, C, N and organic matter. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that the lineage of Soldanella of southern Italy diverged from the Carpathians lineage during the Middle Pleistocene, and underwent an evolutionary radiation during the Late Pleistocene. The populations of the Sila and Aspromonte massifs diverged from the populations of the Gelbison massif around 380000 years ago and are probably undergoing a progressive differentiation due to their isolation. The populations on the Gelbison massif, moreover, have different morphological features from those of the Sila and Aspromonte massifs and a different ecological niche. The molecular, morphological and ecological data clearly demonstrate that the metapopulation of Soldanella on the Gelbison massif belongs to a new taxonomic unit at the species level, which we name Soldanella sacra A. \& L. Bellino from the name of the massif on which it was discovered, the "Holy Mountain".},

This genus and its Australasian relative, Lepilaena, share similar floral characters yet have been treated as different genera or sections of Althenia sensu lato (s.l.) due to the isolated geographic distribution as well as the differences in sex expression, stamen construction, and stigma morphology. The diagnostic characters, however, need reevaluation over the boundaries between the entities. Here we tested the taxonomic delimitation between the entities, assessed synapomorphies for evolutionary lineages, and inferred biogeographic history in a phylogenetic framework. Our results indicated that Lepilaena was resolved as non-monophyletic in both plastid DNA and nuclear PhyC trees and Althenia was nested within it. As Althenia has nomenclatural priority, we propose a new delimitation to recognize Althenia s.l., which can be diagnosed by the female flowers with 3-segmented perianths and male flowers with perianths. The previously used diagnostic characters are either autapomorphies or synapomorphies for small lineages within Althenia s.l., and evolutionary transitions to sessile female flowers and narrow leaves characterize larger clades. Biogeographic analyses suggested a Miocene origin of Althenia s.l. in Australasia and indicated at least one inter- and one intra-specific inter-continental dispersal events among Australasia, Mediterranean Eurasia, and CFR need to be hypothesized to explain the current distribution patterns.},

	abstract = {Portulaca is the only genus in Portulacaceae and has ca. 100 species distributed worldwide, mainly in the tropics and subtropics. Molecular data place the genus as one of the closest relatives of Cactaceae, but phylogenetic relationships within Portulaca are barely known. This study samples 59 species of Portulaca, 10 infraspecific taxa, and three cultivars, including multiple samples of widespread species. The sampled taxa represent all subgenera in the classifications of von Poellnitz (1934), Legrand (1958), and Geesink (1969) and come from around the world. Nuclear ITS and chloroplast ndhF, trnT-psbD intergenic spacer, and ndhA intron DNA sequences were analyzed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to produce a hypothesis of relationships within Portulaca. Divergence times were estimated using Hawaiian endemics for calibration, and biogeographical patterns were examined using a Bayes-DIVA approach. In addition, the evolution of chromosome numbers in the genus was investigated using probabilistic models. The analyses strongly support the monophyly of Portulaca, with an age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of 23 Myr. Within Portulaca are two major lineages: the OL clade (comprising opposite-leaved species) distributed in Africa, Asia, and Australia, and the AL clade (comprising alternate to subopposite-leaved species), which is more widespread and originated in the New World. Sedopsis, a genus sometimes recognized as distinct from Portulaca based on a long corolla tube, is nested within the OL clade and does not merit taxonomic recognition. Samples of Portulaca grandiflora, Portulaca halimoides, and Portulaca oleracea were found to be non-monophyletic. It is hypothesized that the ancestral distribution area of Portulaca included southern hemisphere continents and Asia. The OL clade remained restricted to the Old World (except Portulaca quadrifida, a pantropical weed), while the AL clade, with a South American origin, was able to disperse multiple times to other continents. The base chromosome number for Portulaca is inferred to be x=9, although the analysis was primarily based on the available data for the AL clade. A number of chromosome number change events (polyploidization, demi-polyploidization, gain, and loss) were shown to have occurred in the genus, especially within the Oleracea clade.},

Support is strong for the monophyly of Calandrinia, Montiopsis, Lewisia, Claytonia, and Montia, along with a sister relationship of the last two. The data neither strongly support nor refute the morphologically based diagnosis of Cistanthe, but they strongly support a clade including the North American Cistanthe section Calyptridium and the South American Cistanthe sections Amarantoideae and Philippiamra. The internal transcribed spacer data fail to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among most of the western American lineages, suggesting either rapid radiation or, alternatively, erratic evolution of the internal transcribed spacer. The internal transcribed spacer and morphological evidence together suggest that in this group there have been 8-13 dispersal and colonization events across {\textgreater}2000 km (1 for every 15-26 extant species in this group). The internal transcribed spacer data document complex molecular evolutionary patterns, including strong substitution biases, among-site rate heterogeneity, positional bias for deamination-type substitutions, nonstationarity, and variable rates of insertion/deletion. Our phylogenetic conclusions, however, do not appear to be sensitive to these patterns.},

	abstract = {Most plant phylogenetic inference has used DNA sequence data from the plastid genome. This genome represents a single genealogical sample with no recombination among genes, potentially limiting the resolution of evolutionary relationships in some contexts. In contrast, nuclear DNA is inherently more difficult to employ for phylogeny reconstruction because major mutational events in the genome, including polyploidization, gene duplication, and gene extinction can result in homologous gene copies that are difficult to identify as orthologs or paralogs. Gene tree parsimony (GTP) can be used to infer the rooted species tree by fitting gene genealogies to species trees while simultaneously minimizing the estimated number of duplications needed to reconcile conflicts among them. Here, we use GTP for five nuclear gene families and a previously published plastid data set to reconstruct the phylogenetic backbone of the aquatic plant family Pontederiaceae. Plastid-based phylogenetic studies strongly supported extensive paraphyly of Eichhornia (one of the four major genera) but also depicted considerable ambiguity concerning the true root placement for the family. Our results indicate that species trees inferred from the nuclear genes (alone and in combination with the plastid data) are highly congruent with gene trees inferred from plastid data alone. Consideration of optimal and suboptimal gene tree reconciliations place the root of the family at (or near) a branch leading to the rare and locally restricted E. meyeri. We also explore methods to incorporate uncertainty in individual gene trees during reconciliation by considering their individual bootstrap profiles and relate inferred excesses of gene duplication events on individual branches to whole-genome duplication events inferred for the same branches. Our study improves understanding of the phylogenetic history of Pontederiaceae and also demonstrates the utility of GTP for phylogenetic analysis.},

However, the molecular phylogeny of the genus lags behind. The monophyly of the genus has been uncertain and a modern phylogenetic study of the genus based on molecular data has been lacking. In the present study, DNA sequences of five plastid markers of 220 accessions of Polypodiaceae representing two species of Drymoglossum, 14 species of Platycerium, 50 species of Pyrrosia, and the only species of Saxiglossum (subfamily Platycerioideae), and 12 species of other Polypodiaceae representing the remaining four subfamilies are used to infer a phylogeny of the genus. Major results and conclusions of this study include: (1) Pyrrosia as currently circumscribed is paraphyletic in relation to Platycerium and can be divided into two genera: Pyrrosia s.s. and Hovenkampia (gen. nov.), with Hovenkampia and Platycerium forming a strongly supported clade sister to Pyrrosia s.s.; (2) Subfamily Platycerioideae should contain three genera only, Hovenkampia, Platycerium, and Pyrrosia s.s.; (3) Based on the molecular phylogeny, macromorphology, anatomical features, and spore morphology, four major clades in the genus are identified and three of the four are further resolved into four, four, and six subclades, respectively; (4) Three species, P. angustissima, P. foveolata, and P. mannii, not assigned to any groups by Hovenkamp (1986) because of their unusual morphology, each form monospecific clades; (5) Drymoglossum is not monophyletic and those species previously assigned to this genus are resolved in two different subclades; (6) Saxiglossum is resolved as the first lineage in the Niphopsis clade; and (7) The evolution of ten major morphological characters in the subfamily is inferred based on the phylogeny and various morphological synapomorphies for various clades and subclades are identified.},

Over 4000 nucleotides were sequenced for 77 specimens belonging to 54 species. Each cpDNA region was analyzed separately and combined into a single dataset. All phylogenetic analyses, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian Inference of phylogeny, revealed the paraphyly of Lepisorus with the monotypic Drymotaenium miyoshianum and of the paleotropical genus Belvisia nested within the Lepisorus clade. Nine well-supported major clades were found. The phylogenetic results provided new evidence for the sectional classification of Lepisorus. The evolution of three morphological characters, clathrateness of rhizome scales, margin of rhizome scales and defoliated leaves, and the evolution of the karyotype, were reconstructed to identify lineage specific phenotypic character states or combination of characters. Unique character combinations, rather than synapomorphies, were found to be of systematic value in sectional delimitation. The variation of chromosome numbers is largely due to a single aneuploidy event instead of a stepwise reduction during the evolutionary history of this genus.},

We inferred phylogenetic relationships of 190 species representing 31 of the 33 currently recognized genera of grammitid ferns by analyzing DNA sequence variation of five plastid DNA regions. We estimated the ages of cladogenetic events on an inferred phylogeny using secondary fossil calibration points. Historical biogeographical patterns were inferred via ancestral area reconstruction. Our results supported four large-scale phylogenetic and biogeographic patterns: (1) a monophyletic grammitid clade that arose among Neotropical polypod ancestors about 31.4 Ma; (2) a paraphyletic assemblage of clades distributed in the Neotropics and the Afro-Malagasy region; (3) a large clade distributed throughout the Asia-Malesia-Pacific region that originated about 23.4 Ma; and, (4) an Australian or New Zealand origin of the circumaustral genus Notogrammitis. Most genera were supported as monophyletic except for Grammitis, Oreogrammitis, Radiogrammitis, and Zygophlebia. Grammitid ferns are a well-supported monophyletic group with two biogeographically distinct lineages: a primarily Neotropical grade exhibiting several independent successful colonizations to the Afro-Malagasy region and a primarily Paleotropical clade exhibiting multiple independent dispersals to remote Pacific islands and temperate, austral regions.},

Our analyses recovered four major monophyletic lineages: the loxogrammoids, two clades consisting of taxa restricted to the Old World, and a largely neotropical clade that also includes the pantropical Grammitidaceae. The loxogrammoid lineage diverges first and is sister to a large clade comprising the three remaining species-rich lineages. One paleotropical clade includes the drynarioid and selligueoid ferns, whereas the second paleotropical clade includes the platycerioids, lepisoroids, microsoroids, and their relatives. The grammitids nest within the neotropical clade, although the sister taxon of this circum-tropic, epiphytic group remains ambiguous. Microsorum and Polypodium, as traditionally defined, were recovered as polyphyletic. The relatively short branch lengths of the deepest clades contrast with the long branch lengths leading to the terminal groups. This suggests that the polygrammoid ferns arose through an old, rapid radiation. Our analysis also reveals that the rate of substitution in the grammitids is remarkably higher relative to other polygrammoids. Disparities in substitution rate may be correlated with one or more features characterizing grammitids, including species richness, chlorophyllous spores, and an extended gametophytic phase.},

Most of its American representatives are assembled in a monophyletic clade that, apart from the grammitids, nearly exclusively comprises species restricted to the New World. The phylogenetic relationships of these ferns are still insufficiently understood and many taxonomic problems, such as natural circumscriptions of the genera Polypodium and Pleopeltis, were unresolved. Here we address one of the two main lineages within New World Polypodiaceae including Pecluma, Phlebodium, Pleopeltis, and Polypodium. Our study is based on DNA sequence data from four plastid regions that were generated for 72 species representing all putative major taxonomic groups within this lineage. The analyses reveal three major clades: (1) Polypodium plus Pleurosoriopsis; (2) Pecluma plus Phlebodium, and some species of Polypodium; and (3) Pleopeltis and related genera. The last clade contains species of Pleopeltis and Polypodium as well as Microphlebodium, Neurodium, Dicranoglossum, and Pseudocolysis. All species included in the clade display conspicuous persistent peltate laminar scales that are not found in other species of this lineage. Our results suggest a reconsideration of the generic concept of Pleopeltis with peltate laminar scales being the genus' key character.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY The recognition of monophyletic genera for groups that have high levels of homoplastic morphological characters and/or conflicting results obtained by different studies can be difficult. Such is the case in the grammitid ferns, a clade within the Polypodiaceae. In this study, we aim to resolve relationships among four clades of grammitid ferns, which have been previously recovered either as a polytomy or with conflicting topologies, with the goal of circumscribing monophyletic genera. • METHODS The sampling included 89 specimens representing 61 species, and sequences were obtained for two genes (atpB and rbcL) and four intergenic spacers (atpB-rbcL, rps4-trnS, trnG-trnR, and trnL-trnF), resulting in a matrix of 5091 characters. The combined data set was analyzed using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Ninety-six morphological characters were optimized onto the generated trees, using the parsimony method. • KEY RESULTS Lellingeria is composed of two main clades, the L. myosuroides and the Lellingeria s.s. clades, which together are sister to Melpomene. Sister to all three of these is a clade with two species of the polyphyletic genus Terpsichore. In the L. myosuroides clade, several dispersal events occurred between the neotropics, Africa, and the Pacific Islands, whereas Lellingeria s.s. is restricted to the neotropics, with about 60\% of its diversity in the Andes. • CONCLUSIONS Overall, our results suggest that Lellingeria is monophyletic, with two clades that are easily characterized morphologically and biogeographically. Morphological characters describing the indument are the most important to define the clades within the ingroup. A small clade, previously considered in Terpsichore, should be recognized as a new genus.},

	abstract = {Based on a worldwide phylogenetic framework filling the taxonomic gap of Madagascar and surrounding islands of the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), we revisited the systematics of grammitid fern species (Polypodiaceae). We also investigated the biogeographic origin of the extant diversity in Madagascar and estimated the relative influence of vicariance, long-distance dispersals (LDD) and in situ diversification. Phylogenetic inferences were based on five plastid DNA regions (atpB, rbcL, rps4-trnS, trnG-trnR, trnL-trnF) and the most comprehensive taxonomic sampling ever assembled (224 species belonging to 31 out of 33 recognized grammitids genera). 31 species from Madagascar were included representing 87\% of the described diversity and 77\% of the endemics. Our results confirmed a Paleotropical clade nested within an amphi-Atlantic grade. In addition, we identified three new major clades involving species currently belonging to Grammitis s.l., Ctenopterella and Enterosora. We resolved for the first time Grammitis s.s. as monophyletic, and Ctenopterella (newly tested here) and Enterosora as polyphyletic. The Neotropical genus Moranopteris was shown to also occur in Madagascar through a newly discovered species. Most importantly, we suggest a {\textgreater}30\% inflation of the species number in the WIO due to the hidden diversity in {\textgreater}10 cryptic lineages, best explained by high morphological homoplasy. Molecular dating and ancestral areas reconstruction allowed identifying the Neotropics as the predominant source of LDD to the African-WIO region, with at least 12 colonization events within the last 20Ma. Repeated eastward migrations may be explained by transoceanic westerly winds transporting the dust-like spores. Tropical Asia s.l. would also have played a (minor) role through one dispersal event to Madagascar at the end of the Oligocene. Last, within the complex Malagasy region made of a mosaic of continental and oceanic islands located close to the African continent, we showed that contrary to theoretical expectations and empirical evidence in angiosperms, Africa does not act as a dispersal source and Madagascar seems to have a more important influence on the regional dynamics: we observed both in situ species diversification and dispersal out of Madagascar. This influence also extends beyond the region, since one dispersal event probably originated from Madagascar and reached the Subantarctic island of Amsterdam.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Rheum, a highly diversified genus with about 60 species, is mainly confined to the mountainous and desert regions of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and adjacent areas. This genus represents a good example of the extensive diversification of the temperate genera in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, in which the forces to drive diversification remain unknown. To date, the infrageneric classification of Rheum has been mainly based on morphological characters. However, it may have been subject to convergent evolution under habitat pressure, and the systematic position of some sections are unclear, especially Sect. Globulosa, which has globular inflorescences, and Sect. Nobilia, which has semi-translucent bracts. Recent palynological research has found substantial contradictions between exine patterns and the current classification of Rheum. Two specific objectives of this research were (1) to evaluate possible relationships of some ambiguous sections with a unique morphology, and (2) to examine possible occurrence of the radiative speciation with low genetic divergence across the total genus and the correlation between the extensive diversification time of Rheum and past geographical events, especially the recent large-scale uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. METHODS The chloroplast DNA trnL-F region of 29 individuals representing 26 species of Rheum, belonging to seven out of eight sections, was sequenced and compared. The phylogenetic relationships were further constructed based on the sequences obtained. KEY RESULTS Despite the highly diversified morphology, the genetic variation in this DNA fragment is relatively low. The molecular phylogeny is highly inconsistent with gross morphology, pollen exine patterns and traditional classifications, except for identifying all samples of Sect. Palmata, three species of Sect. Spiciformia and a few species of Sect. Rheum as corresponding monophyletic groups. The monotypic Sect. Globulosa showed a tentative position within the clade comprising five species of Sect. Rheum. All of the analyses revealed the paraphyly of R. nobile and R. alexandrae, the only two species of Sect. Nobilia circumscribed by the possession of large bracts. The crude calibration of lineages based on trnL-F sequence differentiation implied an extensive diversification of Rheum within approx. 7 million years. CONCLUSIONS Based on these results, it is suggested that the rich geological and ecological diversity caused by the recent large-scale uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau since the late Tertiary, coupled with the oscillating climate of the Quaternary stage, might have promoted rapid speciation in small and isolated populations, as well as allowing the fixation of unique or rare morphological characters in Rheum. Such a rapid radiation, combined with introgressive hybridization and reticulate evolution, may have caused the transfer of cpDNA haplotypes between morphologically dissimilar species, and might account for the inconsistency between morphological classification and molecular phylogeny reported here.},

Parapteropyrum, a monotypic shrubby genus occurring in the central QTP, has been previously placed in the tribe Atraphaxideae of the family Polygonaceae, while all the other woody species of this tribe mainly occur in western and central Asia. We studied sequence variations of nuclear ITS (internal transcribed spacer) and cp (chloroplast) DNA (rbcL and accD) of this genus and the other ten genera. The constructed phylogenies based on ITS, cpDNA or a combination of both datasets, suggest that the woody Parapteropyrum is nested within and most likely evolved from the herbaceous Fagopyrum. We propose that the large-scale uplift of the QTP not only promoted continental species radiation, but also the secondary feature of woodiness in a few herbaceous lineages in response to strong selection pressures, similar to those acting on island flora. In addition, the confirmation of Parapteropyrum within Fagopyrum highlights its potential use as a new, perennial source of buckwheat.},

Phylogenetic analyses indicate that all species of Rheum form a monophyletic lineage sister to the two-species genus Oxyria, indicating that radiative diversifications have occurred in its evolutionary history. Our dating analyses further suggest that these radiations largely coincided with the extensive uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Ancestral state reconstruction and likelihood sensitivity tests strongly indicate that both decumbent and 'glasshouse-like' body-plan traits evolved in parallel in different clades.

Incongruence among gene trees can provide critical insights, especially when combined with data on chromosome numbers, morphology, and geography. To further test our previous hypothesis on hybrid speciation in Persicaria (Polygonaceae), we performed molecular phylogenetic studies using three cpDNA regions and nuclear ITS sequences, with an emphasis on sampling within section Eupersicaria. Our analyses revealed major conflicts between the combined cpDNA tree and the nrITS tree; a variety of incongruence tests rejected stochastic error as the cause of incongruence in most cases. On the basis of our tree incongruence results and information on chromosome numbers, we hypothesize that the origin of 10 polyploid species involved interspecific hybridization. Our studies also support the recognition of several previously named species that have been treated as belonging within other species. Repeated allotetraploidy (as distinct from radiation at the tetraploid level) now appears to be the key mechanism governing the diversification of this taxonomically challenging group.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY Taxonomic groups have often been recognized on the basis of geographic distinctions rather than accurately representing evolutionary relationships. This has been particularly true for temperate and tropical members from the same family. Polygonaceae exemplifies this problem, wherein the woody tropical genera were segregated from temperate members of the family and placed in the subfamily Polygonoideae as two tribes: Triplarideae and Coccolobeae. Modern phylogenetic studies, especially when inferred from many lines of evidence, can elucidate more probable hypotheses of relationships. This study builds on previous work in the family and aims to test the traditional classification of the tropical woody taxa, which have been understudied and undersampled compared to their temperate relatives. • METHODS A phylogenetic study was undertaken with expanded sampling of the tropical genera with data from five plastid markers (psbA-trnH, psaI-accD, matK, ndhF, and rbcL), nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) and morphology. • KEY RESULTS Results support the placement of nine of 12 genera of the Triplarideae and Coccolobeae within Eriogonoideae, in which these genera form a paraphyletic assemblage giving rise to Eriogoneae. The remaining woody tropical genera excluded from Eriogonoideae occur in the paleotropics. • CONCLUSIONS Traditional characters used to delimit Coccolobeae and Triplarideae are not useful for defining monophyletic groups. The six-tepal condition is derived from the five-tepal condition, and unisexual flowers have arisen multiple times in different sexual systems. Ruminate endosperm has arisen multiple times in the family, suggesting this character is highly plastic.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The mycoheterotrophic lifestyle has enabled some plant lineages to obtain carbon from their mycorrhizal symbionts. The mycoheterotrophic genus Epirixanthes (Polygalaceae) consists of six species from tropical Asia. Although it is probably closely related to the chlorophyllous genus Salomonia and linked to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, lack of DNA sequence data has thus far prevented these hypotheses from being tested. Therefore, the evolutionary history of Epirixanthes remains largely unknown. METHODS We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of Epirixanthes based on nuclear ITS and plastid matK data. Divergence times were inferred using a Bayesian relaxed clock approach, and we phylogenetically analyzed its mycorrhizal symbionts. We furthermore assigned these symbionts to operational taxonomic units, compared them with symbionts of other Polygalaceae, and measured their phylogenetic diversity. KEY RESULTS We found that Epirixanthes is placed in tribe Polygaleae as sister to Salomonia. Epirixanthes has a Miocene-Oligocene stem age and grows exclusively in symbiosis with fungi of Glomeraceae. Salomonia and some Polygala species are linked to both Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae, resulting in higher phylogenetic diversity values. The majority of the symbionts of Epirixanthes are not found in Salomonia or Polygala, although a few shared fungal taxa are found. CONCLUSIONS Epirixanthes forms a relatively young mycoheterotrophic lineage. The Oligocene-Miocene origin suggests its evolution was influenced by the environmental dynamics in Southeast Asia during this time. Although comparison of fungi from Epirixanthes with those from Salomonia and Polygala suggests some specialization, many other mycoheterotrophic plants are linked to a more narrow set of Glomeraceae.},

The previously recognised subgenus Muraltia is monophyletic, but the South African endemic genus Nylandtia is embedded in Muraltia subgenus Psiloclada. Subgenus Muraltia is found to be sister to subgenus Psiloclada. Estimates show the beginning of diversification of the two subgenera in the early Miocene (Psiloclada, 19.3+/-3.4 Ma; Muraltia, 21.0+/-3.5 Ma) pre-dating the establishment of the Benguela current (intermittent in the middle to late Oligocene and markedly intensifying in the late Miocene), and summer-dry climate in the Cape region. However, the later increase in species numbers is contemporaneous with these climatic phenomena. Results of dispersal-vicariance analyses indicate that major clades in Muraltia diversified from the southwestern and northwestern Cape, where most of the species are found today.},

The phylogenetic utility of the two sequence regions was evaluated in Polemoniaceae with a focus on Saltugilia, an incipient species complex that lacks phylogenetic resolution among these same taxa based on nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast trnL. Multiple sequences from several individuals, multiple individuals from several populations, and multiple populations from all Saltugilia species were sampled to evaluate the taxonomic level at which idhB was useful as a phylogenetic marker in this clade. Phylogenies based on idhB sequences were compared with topological resolution and clade composition in ITS and trnL phylogenies. Phylogenies based on idhB and idhB in combination with ITS and trnL are better resolved than any other phylogenies for Saltugilia published to date, and character evolution within Saltugilia is explored.},

Despite its biological importance, no family-wide phylogenetic estimate based on multiple DNA regions with complete generic sampling is available. Here, we analyze one nuclear and five chloroplast DNA sequence regions (nuclear ITS, chloroplast matK, trnL intron plus trnL-trnF intergeneric spacer, and the trnS-trnG, trnD-trnT, and psbM-trnD intergenic spacers) using parsimony and Bayesian methods, as well as assessments of congruence and long branch attraction, to explore phylogenetic relationships among 84 ingroup species representing all currently recognized Polemoniaceae genera. Relationships inferred from the ITS and concatenated chloroplast regions are similar overall. A combined analysis provides strong support for the monophyly of Polemoniaceae and subfamilies Acanthogilioideae, Cobaeoideae, and Polemonioideae. Relationships among subfamilies, and thus for the precise root of Polemoniaceae, remain poorly supported. Within the largest subfamily, Polemonioideae, four clades corresponding to tribes Polemonieae, Phlocideae, Gilieae, and Loeselieae receive strong support. The monogeneric Polemonieae appears sister to Phlocideae. Relationships within Polemonieae, Phlocideae, and Gilieae are mostly consistent between analyses and data permutations. Many relationships within Loeselieae remain uncertain. Overall, inferred phylogenetic relationships support a higher-level classification for Polemoniaceae proposed in 2000.},

Sampling was the same as that for the ITS study and consisted of 79 samples (including all 22 eastern Phlox species and most eastern subspecies, as well as multiple populations of many taxa). The resulting cpDNA phylogeny agrees with the ITS phylogeny in many respects, strengthening earlier conclusions. Nevertheless, incongruence between the trees is noteworthy: many samples, particularly of members of the P. pilosa and P. glaberrima complexes, are placed in different clades. A variety of tests were carried out to assess congruence in terms of topological patterns, character congruence, and homogeneity of data sets. Significant conflict between the phylogenies is discussed in light of the hypothesis that hybridization has affected relationships in this genus.},

	doi = {10.1006/mpev.1998.0577},
	abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships of some angiosperm families have remained enigmatic despite broad phylogenetic analyses of rbcL sequences. One example is the aquatic family Podostemaceae, the relationships of which have long been controversial because of major morphological modifications associated with their aquatic habit. Podostemaceae have variously been associated with Piperaceae, Nepenthaceae, Polygonaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Rosaceae, Crassulaceae, and Saxifragaceae. Two recent analyses of rbcL sequences suggest a possible sister-group relationship of Podostemaceae to Crassulaceae (Saxifragales). However, the branch leading to Podostemaceae was long, and use of different outgroups resulted in alternative placements. We explored the phylogenetic relationships of Podostemaceae using 18S rDNA sequences and a combined rbcL + 18S rDNA matrix representing over 250 angiosperms. In analyses based on 18S rDNA data, Podostemaceae are not characterized by a long branch; the family consistently appears as part of a Malpighiales clade that also includes Malpighiaceae, Turneraceae, Passifloraceae, Salicaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Violaceae, Linaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Trigoniaceae, Humiriaceae, and Ochnaceae. Phylogenetic analyses based on a combined 18S rDNA + rbcL data set (223 ingroup taxa) with basal angiosperms as the outgroup also suggest that Podostemaceae are part of a Malpighiales clade. These searches swapped to completion, and the shortest trees showed enhanced resolution and increased internal support compared to those based on 18S rDNA or rbcL alone. However, when Gnetales are used as the outgroup, Podostemaceae appear with members of the nitrogen fixing clade (e.g., Elaeagnaceae, Ulmaceae, Rhamnaceae, Cannabaceae, Moraceae, and Urticaceae). None of the relationships suggested here for Podostemaceae receives strong bootstrap support. Our analyses indicate that Podostemaceae are not closely allied with Crassulaceae or with other members of the Saxifragales clade; their closest relatives, although still uncertain, appear to lie elsewhere in the rosids.},

Diplobryum koyamae, transferred to the genus Hydrodiscus described in this paper, has long-floating shoots with an anchoring disk-like base and is rootless. Such a body plan is distinct from other members of Asian Podostemoideae comprising reduced or moderate shoots borne on the root. Here, our molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that H. koyamae is sister to a crustose-rooted group of Hanseniella, Hydrobryum and Thawatchaia within Asian Podostemoideae. The germinating embryo was devoid of plumule and radicle, and comprised a single cotyledon and a short hypocotyl, which produced an adventitious shoot endogenously. The leaves are formed in the absence of the shoot apical meristem, accompanying the separation of lightly stained cells. Comparison with other species of Asian Podostemoideae having the plumule and the adventitious root in the seedling, along with their phylogenetic relationship, suggests that saltational evolution occurred in the seedling body plan of H. koyamae leading to the extraordinary adult body plan, as in the separate clade of Dalzellia, Indodalzellia, and Indotristicha of the subfamily Tristichoideae.},

	abstract = {The moss-like river-weeds or Podostemaceae offer a special opportunity to study the diversity and evolution of plants that are adapted to extreme environments. This paper reviews multidisciplinary studies on this subject. Based on field work in the four continents, we discovered many species and several genera that are new components of biodiversity, and revealed the Podostemaceae floras of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia. The historical biogeography of the family, i.e., the change in distribution in space and time, is characterized by a few dispersals between continents, followed by diversification within each continent. Local species may be derived from parts of separated populations of parental species, which consequently are paraphyletic. The remarkable morphological adaptations of Podostemaceae include the development of the horizontal axis in plant body, with which the plants adhere to rock surfaces under violent current. The vertical axis is reduced or lost and the horizontal axis develops in the embryo and seedling. We also found saltational organ-level variation, such as presence or absence of shoot, shoot apical meristem, root, and root cap; the form of shoot and root; the mode of root branching and leaf production; and the number of cotyledons. Morphological evolution may not be always adaptive to the habitats, which are rocks periodically submerged across the distribution range. Analyses of shoot regulatory gene expression found that, in contrast to the expression pattern in primitive species with ordinary shoots, which is comparable with Arabidopsis, the unique pattern in derived species may result in 'fuzzy' morphology of the shoot and leaf. Finally, problems for future study are pointed out.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Podostemaceae is a unique family of aquatic angiosperms that grow in swift-running water on rock surfaces in the tropics. Their plant bodies show a remarkable adaptation: the main plant body is mostly creeping or flattened, or in extreme cases foliose, functioning as an adhering and photosynthetic organ. In the subfamily Podostemoideae, the root is foliose, whereas in the subfamily Tristichoideae, the shoot is foliose. An evolutionary scenario for the foliose root has already been proposed, but that for the foliose shoot remains to be addressed. METHODS Shoots of Indodalzellia gracilis and Dalzellia ubonensis (subfamily Tristichoideae) were observed using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Gene expression patterns of orthologs of marker genes for the shoot apical meristem, i.e., SHOOT MERISTEMLESS and WUSCHEL, in D. ubonensis were analyzed. KEY RESULTS When very young, the phyllotaxis is tristichous in both genera: a set of one dorsal and two marginal leaves forms. When the shoot branches, extra-axillary buds of two subsequent marginal leaves form as new (lateral) shoots, and the original shoot stops growing; this growth pattern is called sympodial branching. Due to zonal growth in the common zone just below the original and lateral shoot apices, flattened or foliose shoots result. The expression patterns of DuSTM and DuWUS in the shoot apices of Dalzellia were similar to those published for Terniopsis. CONCLUSIONS The foliose shoots of Indodalzellia and Dalzellia evolved as a result of congenital fusion among several original and lateral branches, each of which grows separately in other Tristichoideae.},

	abstract = {Panicum sensu stricto is a genus of grasses (Poaceae) with nearly, according to this study, 163 species distributed worldwide. This genus is included in the subtribe Panicinae together with Louisiella, the latter with 2 species. Panicum and subtribe Panicinae are characterized by including annual or perennial taxa with open and lax panicles, and spikelets with the lower glume reduced; all taxa also share a basic chromosome number of x = 9 and a Kranz leaf blade anatomy typical of the NAD-me subtype photosynthetic pathway. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic placements of many Panicum species, and the circumscription of the genus, remained untested. Therefore, phylogenetic analyses were conducted using sequence data from the ndhF plastid region, in an extensive worldwide sampling of Panicum and related genera, in order to infer evolutionary relationships and to provide a phylogenetic framework to review the classification of the genus. Diversification times, historical biogeography and evolutionary patterns of the life history (annual vs. perennial) in the subtribe and Panicum were also studied. Results obtained provide strong support for a monophyletic Panicum including 71 species and 7 sections, of which sections Arthragrostis and Yakirra are new in the genus; 7 new combinations are made here. Furthermore, 32 species traditionally assigned to Panicum were excluded from the genus, and discussed in other subtribes of Paniceae. Our study suggested that early diversification in subtribe Panicinae and Panicum occurred through the Early-Mid Miocene in the Neotropics, while the subsequent diversification of its sections mainly occurred in the Late Miocene-Pleistocene, involving multiple dispersals to all continents. Our analyses also showed that transition rates and changes between annual and perennial life history in Panicum were quite frequent, suggesting considerable lability of this trait. Changes of the life history, together with C4 photosynthesis, and the multiple dispersal events since the Mid Miocene, seem to have facilitated a widespread distribution of the genus. All these findings contribute to a better understanding of the systematics and evolution of Panicum.},

In the West African savannah, Panicum spp. and closely related taxa dominate the landscape, with species differentially adapted to drought conditions. We obtained four chloroplast DNA barcode sequences, rbcL, matK, ndhF and trnH-psbA intergenic region, for nine Panicum spp. with a focus on West African species, and we performed maximum likelihood analysis to infer their phylogenetic relationship. Furthermore the phylogenetic placement of five newly sequenced taxa was achieved using a published phylogeny of more than 300 Panicoids based on ndhF sequences. The comparison of the resulting phylogenetic tree constructed from a combination of all four barcode sequences with the one based on rbcL and matK showed that the latter combination of the two, is sufficient for the analysis. A tree constructed from amino acid sequences derived from isolated cDNAs of the nucleus-encoded phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase displayed a similar topology. All ppc-sequences could be annotated to either ppc-B2 or ppc-aR. Moreover the inclusion of the West African Panicum species in an extensive dataset of Panicoids supports the proposition that within the subtribe Panicinae only the NAD-malic enzyme type of C4 photosynthesis is present.},

In a recent phylogenetic study, 10 major lineages in Arundinarieae were resolved based on eight non-coding plastid regions, which conflicted significantly with morphological classifications both at the subtribal and generic levels. Nevertheless, relationships among and within the 10 lineages remain unclear. In order to further unravel the evolutionary history of Arundinarieae, we used the nuclear GBSSI gene sequences along with those of eight plastid regions for phylogenetic reconstruction, with an emphasis on Chinese species. The results of the plastid analyses agreed with previous studies, whereas 13 primary clades revealed in the GBSSI phylogeny were better resolved at the generic level than the plastid phylogeny. Our analyses also revealed many inconsistencies between the plastid DNA and the nuclear GBSSI trees. These results implied that the nuclear genome and the plastid genome had different evolutionary trajectories. The patterns of incongruence suggested that lack of informative characters, incomplete lineage sorting, and/or hybridization (introgression) could be the causes. Seven putative hybrid species were hypothesized, four of which are discussed in detail on the basis of topological incongruence, chromosome numbers, morphology, and distribution patterns, and those taxa probably resulted from homoploid hybrid speciation. Overall, our study indicates that the tribe Arundinarieae has undergone a complex evolution.},

Biogeographic analyses revealed that the Arundinarieae diversified from an estimated 12 to 14Mya, and this was followed by rapid radiation within the lineages, particularly lineages IV, V and VI, starting from c. 7-8Mya. It is suggested that the late Miocene intensification of East Asian monsoon may have contributed to this burst of diversification. The possibilities of the extant Sri Lankan and African temperate bamboo lineages representing 'basal elements' could be excluded, indicating that there is no evidence to support the Indian or African route for migration of temperate bamboo ancestors to Asia. Radiations from eastern Asia to Africa, Sri Lanka, and to North America all are likely to have occurred during the Pliocene, to form the disjunct distribution of Arundinarieae we observe today. The two African lineages are inferred as being derived independently from Asian ancestors, either by overland migrations or long-distance dispersals. Beringian migration may explain the eastern Asian-eastern North American disjunction.},

	abstract = {The temperate bamboos (tribe Arundinarieae) are notorious for being taxonomically extremely difficult. China contains some of the world's greatest diversity of the tribe Arundinarieae, with most genera and species endemic. Previous investigation into phylogenetic relationships of the temperate bamboos revealed several major clades, but emphasis on the species-level relationships among taxa in North America and Japan. To further elucidate relationships among the temperate bamboos, a very broad sampling of Chinese representatives was examined. We produced 9463 bp of sequences from eight non-coding chloroplast regions for 146 species in 26 genera and 5 outgroups. The loci sequenced were atpI/H, psaA-ORF170, rpl32-trnL, rpoB-trnC, rps16-trnQ, trnD/T, trnS/G, and trnT/L. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference supported the monophyly of Arundinarieae. The two major subtribes, Arundinariinae and Shibataeinae, defined on the basis of different synflorescence types, were indicated to be polyphyletic. Most genera in this tribe were confirmed to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic. The cladograms suggest that Arundinarieae is divided into ten major lineages. In addition to six lineages suggested in a previous molecular study (Bergbamboes, the African alpine bamboos, Chimonocalamus, the Shibataea clade, the Phyllostachys clade, and the Arundinaria clade), four additional lineages were recovered in our results, each represented by a single species: Gaoligongshania megalothyrsa, Indocalamus sinicus, Indocalamus wilsonii, Thamnocalamus spathiflorus. Our analyses also indicate that (1) even more than 9000 bp of fast-evolving plastid sequence data cannot resolve the inter- and infra-relationships among and within the ten lineages of the tribe Arundinarieae; (2) an extensive sampling is indispensable for phylogeny reconstruction in this tribe, especially given that many genera appear to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic. Perhaps the ideal way to further illuminate relationships among the temperate bamboos is to sample multiple nuclear loci or whole chloroplast sequences in order to obtain sufficient variation.},

All examined ingroup taxa were clustered into two clades, i.e., the Bambusinae+Dinochloa clade and the Melocanninae clade.

The reconstruction of ancestral fruit characters indicated that the bacoid caryopsis, namely, fleshy or berry-like fruits, was found to be scattered in three lineages of the examined paleotropical woody bamboos. Fruit characters are thus not reliable indicators of phylogeny and bacoid caryopsis likely represents a specialization for particular ecological conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Bambusoideae (Poaceae) comprise three distinct and well-supported lineages: tropical woody bamboos (Bambuseae), temperate woody bamboos (Arundinarieae) and herbaceous bamboos (Olyreae). Phylogenetic studies using chloroplast markers have generally supported a sister relationship between Bambuseae and Olyreae. This suggests either at least two origins of the woody bamboo syndrome in this subfamily or its loss in Olyreae. RESULTS Here a full chloroplast genome (plastome) phylogenomic study is presented using the coding and noncoding regions of 13 complete plastomes from the Bambuseae, eight from Olyreae and 10 from Arundinarieae. Trees generated using full plastome sequences support the previously recovered monophyletic relationship between Bambuseae and Olyreae. In addition to these relationships, several unique plastome features are uncovered including the first mitogenome-to-plastome horizontal gene transfer observed in monocots. CONCLUSIONS Phylogenomic agreement with previous published phylogenies reinforces the validity of these studies. Additionally, this study presents the first published plastomes from Neotropical woody bamboos and the first full plastome phylogenomic study performed within the herbaceous bamboos. Although the phylogenomic tree presented in this study is largely robust, additional studies using nuclear genes support monophyly in woody bamboos as well as hybridization among previous woody bamboo lineages. The evolutionary history of the Bambusoideae could be further clarified using transcriptomic techniques to increase sampling among nuclear orthologues and investigate the molecular genetics underlying the development of woody and floral tissues.},

We used data from morphology and three chloroplast DNA intergenic regions to address taxonomic questions concerning Glyceria in North America, particularly the status of G. declinata, G. occidentalis, G. fluitans, G. striata, and G. elata in western North America. The chloroplast data confirmed the presence of two European species, G. declinata and G. fluitans, in western North America. Glyceria occidentalis was exceptional among the taxa studied in having chloroplast genotypes that fell into two different clades, one of which contained G. fluitans and the other the North American species G. leptostachya. The morphological data showed G. occidentalis to be intermediate between G. fluitans and G. leptostachya with respect to their distinguishing characters. Based on these results, we hypothesize that G. occidentalis consists of hybrids between G. fluitans and G. leptostachya. Glyceria elata and G. striata, which have sometimes been treated as a single species, had different chloroplast genotypes, supporting their recognition as distinct taxa.

	abstract = {Species delimitation is a vital issue concerning evolutionary biology and conservation of biodiversity. However, it is a challenging task for several reasons, including the low interspecies variability of markers currently used in phylogenetic reconstructions and the occurrence of reticulate evolution and polyploidy in many lineages of flowering plants. The first phylogeny of the grass genus Eriochrysis is presented here, focusing on the New World species, in order to examine its relationships to other genera of the subtribe Saccharinae/tribe Andropogoneae and to define the circumscriptions of its taxonomically complicated species. Molecular cloning and sequencing of five regions of four low-copy nuclear genes (apo1, d8, ep2-ex7 and ep2-ex8, kn1) were performed, as well as complete plastome sequencing. Trees were reconstructed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses. The present phylogenetic analyses indicate that Eriochrysis is monophyletic and the Old World E. pallida is sister to the New World species. Subtribe Saccharinae is polyphyletic, as is the genus Eulalia. Based on nuclear and plastome sequences plus morphology, we define the circumscriptions of the New World species of Eriochrysis: E. laxa is distinct from E. warmingiana, and E. villosa is distinct from E. cayennensis. Natural hybrids occur between E. laxa and E. villosa. The hybrids are probably tetraploids, based on the number of paralogues in the nuclear gene trees. This is the first record of a polyploid taxon in the genus Eriochrysis. Some incongruities between nuclear genes and plastome analyses were detected and are potentially caused by incomplete lineage sorting and/or ancient hybridization. The set of low-copy nuclear genes used in this study seems to be sufficient to resolve phylogenetic relationships and define the circumscriptions of other species complexes in the grass family and relatives, even in the presence of polyploidy and reticulate evolution. Complete plastome sequencing is also a promising tool for phylogenetic inference.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Polyploidy and reticulate evolution are often a complication for discovering phylogenetic relationships between genera and species. Despite the huge economic importance of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum-Poaceae, Andropogoneae), the limits of the genus Saccharum and its species are complex and largely unresolved, involving both polyploidy and reticulate evolution. This study aimed to assess the phylogenetic relationships of Saccharum s.l., including Erianthus and Tripidium, as well as investigate the taxonomic circumscription of the South American species of the genus. METHODS Molecular cloning and sequencing of five regions of four low-copy nuclear loci were performed, including Aberrant panicle organization1 (apo1), Dwarf8 (d8), two exons of Erect panicle2 (ep2-ex7 and ep2-ex8), and Retarded palea1 (rep1). Concatenated trees were reconstructed using Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian Inference analyses. KEY RESULTS The allopolyploid origin of Saccharum was demonstrated using evidence from nuclear genes. The samples of Saccharum s.l. grouped in two distinct clades, with S. arundinaceum and S. ravennae (= Tripidium, or Erianthus sect. Ripidium) apart from all other species analyzed of the genus. Saccharum angustifolium, S. asperum, and S. villosum correspond to distinct clades (different species). The plants with intermediate morphology between S. angustifolium and S. villosum presented a pattern of paralogues consistent with a hybrid origin. CONCLUSIONS Saccharum s.l. is polyphyletic and Tripidium should be recognized as a distinct genus. However, no strong evidence was found to support the segregation of Erianthus. The taxonomic circumscription of the South American species of the genus was resolved and the occurrence of natural hybrids was documented. Better understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of Saccharum and relatives may be useful for sugarcane breeders to identify potential taxa for interspecific and intergeneric crosses in the genetic improvement of sugarcane.},

Paniceae are also valuable for answering scientific and evolutionary questions about C4 photosynthetic evolution, drought tolerance, and spikelet variation. However, the phylogeny of the tribe remains incompletely resolved. METHODS Forty-five taxa were selected from across the tribe Paniceae and outgroups for genome survey sequencing (GSS). These data were used to build a phylogenetic tree of the Paniceae based on 102 markers (78 chloroplast, 22 mitochondrial, 2 nrDNA). Ancestral state reconstruction analyses were also performed within the Paniceae using both the traditional and two subtype classification systems to test hypotheses of C4 subtype evolution. KEY RESULTS The phylogenetic tree resolves many areas of the Paniceae with high support and provides insight into the origin and number of C4 evolution events within the tribe. The recovered phylogeny and ancestral state reconstructions support between four and seven independent origins of C4 photosynthesis within the tribe and indicate which species are potentially the closest C3 sister taxa of each of these events. CONCLUSIONS Although the sequence of evolutionary events that produced multiple C4 subtypes within the Paniceae remains undetermined, the results presented here are consistent with only a subset of currently proposed models. The species used in this study constitute a panel of C3 and C4 grasses that are suitable for further studies on C4 photosynthesis, bioenergy, food and forage crops, and various developmental features of the Paniceae.},

Here, we used the concatenation approach and coalescent-based species tree methods to reconstruct the phylogeny of Zizaniinae based on sequences of 14 nuclear single-copy loci and concatenated chloroplast fragments. Despite the low resolution of the tree from concatenated data and substantial topological incongruence of individual gene trees, the species trees inferred from three coalescent-based methods were fully concordant and highly supported. Importantly, the genus Hygroryza was consistently recovered with strong support by all coalescent-based methods. Further various phylogenetic analyses indicated that incomplete lineage sorting was the most likely process that generated pervasive discordance among individual gene trees, although hybridization and introgression cannot be excluded completely. Our species tree inferences based on multilocus data successfully resolved the phylogenetic relationships of the Zizaniinae lineages and confirmed that ancient rapid radiation has taken place in the diversification history of Zizaniinae. This study demonstrates that coalescent-based species tree approaches outperformed the concatenation method and could effectively decipher ancient rapid radiations as long as well resolved individual gene trees were sufficiently sampled.},

Characterization of the second largest subunit of low-copy nuclear RNA polymerase II (RPB2) has indicated that MITE and indels have shaped the homoeologous RPB2 loci in the St and H genome of Eymus species in Triticeae. The aims of this study was to determine if there is MITE in the RPB2 gene in Hordeum genomes, and to compare the gene evolution of RPB2 with other diploid Triticeae species. The sequences were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of the genus Hordeum. METHODS RPB2 regions from all diploid species of Hordeum, one tetraploid species (H. brevisubulatum) and ten accessions of diploid Triticeae species were amplified and sequenced. Parsimony analysis of the DNA dataset was performed in order to reveal the phylogeny of Hordeum species. KEY RESULTS MITE was detected in the Xu genome. A 27-36 bp indel sequence was found in the I and Xu genome, but deleted in the Xa and some H genome species. Interestingly, the indel length in H genomes corresponds well to their geographical distribution. Phylogenetic analysis of the RPB2 sequences positioned the H and Xa genome in one monophyletic group. The I and Xu genomes are distinctly separated from the H and Xa ones. The RPB2 data also separated all New World H genome species except H. patagonicum ssp. patagonicum from the Old World H genome species. CONCLUSIONS MITE and large indels have shaped the RPB2 loci between the Xu and H, I and Xa genomes. The phylogenetic analysis of the RPB2 sequences confirmed the monophyly of Hordeum. The maximum-parsimony analysis demonstrated the four genomes to be subdivided into two groups.},

	abstract = {Echinolaena and Ichnanthus are two tropical grass genera distributed mostly in the Americas, characterized by the presence of rachilla appendages in the shape of convex swellings, scars or wings at the base of the upper anthecium. However, recent studies have shown that rachilla appendages arose several times independently in several groups within Paniceae and Paspaleae (Panicoideae). Thus, this study aimed to assess the monophyly of Echinolaena and Ichnanthus and their relationship to other genera of Paniceae and Paspaleae, especially those including species with rachilla appendages. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of the cpDNA regions ndhF, rpl16, trnH-(rps19)-psbA, trnL-trnF, trnS-(psbZ)-trnG, and the rDNA ITS region included 29 of the 39 known species of Echinolaena and Ichnanthus, 23 of which were sampled for the first time. The multiple loci analyses indicated that Echinolaena and Ichnanthus are polyphyletic in their current circumscriptions, with species in four distinct lineages within subtribe Paspalinae, each one characterized by a single type of rachilla appendage. Thus, Echinolaena and Ichnanthus are each circumscribed in a narrow sense, and the other two lineages excluded from them are proposed as the new genera Hildaea and Oedochloa, resulting in 15 new combinations and the restablishment of I. oplismenoides Munro ex Döll.},

	abstract = {Leymus Hochst. (Triticeae: Poaceae), a group of allopolyploid species with the NsXm genomes, is a perennial genus with diversity in morphology, cytology, ecology, and distribution in the Triticeae. To investigate the genome origin and evolutionary history of Leymus, three unlinked low-copy nuclear genes (Acc1, Pgk1, and GBSSI) and three chloroplast regions (trnL-F, matK, and rbcL) of 32 Leymus species were analyzed with those of 36 diploid species representing 18 basic genomes in the Triticeae. The phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using Bayesian inference, Maximum parsimony, and NeighborNet methods. A time-calibrated phylogeny was generated to estimate the evolutionary history of Leymus. The results suggest that reticulate evolution has occurred in Leymus species, with several distinct progenitors contributing to the Leymus. The molecular data in resolution of the Xm-genome lineage resulted in two apparently contradictory results, with one placing the Xm-genome lineage as closely related to the P/F genome and the other splitting the Xm-genome lineage as sister to the Ns-genome donor. Our results suggested that (1) the Ns genome of Leymus was donated by Psathyrostachys, and additional Ns-containing alleles may be introgressed into some Leymus polyploids by recurrent hybridization; (2) The phylogenetic incongruence regarding the resolution of the Xm-genome lineage suggested that the Xm genome of Leymus was closely related to the P genome of Agropyron; (3) Both Ns- and Xm-genome lineages served as the maternal donor during the speciation of Leymus species; (4) The Pseudoroegneria, Lophopyrum and Australopyrum genomes contributed to some Leymus species.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY The subfamily Panicoideae (Poaceae) encompasses nearly one-third of the diversity of grass species, including important crops such as maize and sugarcane. Previous analyses recovered strong support for a Panicoideae+Centothecoideae lineage within the diverse Panicoideae+Arundinoideae+Chloridoideae+Micrairoideae+Aristidoideae+Danthonioideae (PACMAD) clade, although support for internal relationships was inconsistent. The objectives of this research were to (1) further test the monophyly of each subfamily and previously recovered clades within the Panicoideae+Centothecoideae lineage, (2) establish phylogenetic relationships among these groups, and (3) propose a new tribal classification for this lineage based explicitly on the phylogeny. • METHODS Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses of 37 taxa were based on previously published sequences (ndhF and rpl16 intron) and on new plastid and nuclear (rbcL and granule-bound starch synthase I) sequence data as well as structural data. • Key results. The Panicoideae+Centothecoideae lineage and a majority of the clades identified in previous analyses continue to be robustly supported, but resolution along the backbone of the topology remains elusive. Support for the monophyly of both subfamilies was lacking although support values for some clades increased. The tribes Centotheceae and Arundinelleae were confirmed as polyphyletic. • CONCLUSIONS Subfamily Centothecoideae is formally submerged into the Panicoideae, and a new tribal classification for the expanded Panicoideae is proposed based explicitly on the phylogeny. This classification includes 12 tribes of which Chasmanthieae and Zeugiteae are segretated from the Centotheceae; Tristachyideae is segregated from Arundinelleae, and a new tribe, Cyperochloeae, is validated to accommodate two isolated genera. A key to the tribes is provided.},

	abstract = {Circumscriptions of and relationships among many genera and suprageneric taxa of the diverse grass tribe Poeae remain controversial. In an attempt to clarify these, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of {\textgreater}2400 new DNA sequences from two nuclear ribosomal regions (ITS, including internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 and the 5.8S gene, and the 3'-end of the external transcribed spacer (ETS)) and five plastid regions (matK, trnL-trnF, atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI, psbA-rps19-trnH), and of more than 1000 new and previously published ITS sequences, focused particularly on Poeae chloroplast group 1 and including broad and increased species sampling compared to previous studies. Deep branches in the combined plastid and combined ITS+ETS trees are generally well resolved, the trees are congruent in most aspects, branch support across the trees is stronger than in trees based on only ITS and fewer plastid regions, and there is evidence of conflict between data partitions in some taxa. In plastid trees, a strongly supported clade corresponds to Poeae chloroplast group 1 and includes Agrostidinae p.p., Anthoxanthinae, Aveninae s.str., Brizinae, Koeleriinae (sometimes included in Aveninae s.l.), Phalaridinae and Torreyochloinae. In the ITS+ETS tree, a supported clade includes these same tribes as well as Sesleriinae and Scolochloinae. Aveninae s.str. and Sesleriinae are sister taxa and form a clade with Koeleriinae in the ITS+ETS tree whereas Aveninae s.str. and Koeleriinae form a clade and Sesleriinae is part of Poeae chloroplast group 2 in the plastid tree. All species of Trisetum are part of Koeleriinae, but the genus is polyphyletic. Koeleriinae is divided into two major subclades: one comprises Avellinia, Gaudinia, Koeleria, Rostraria, Trisetaria and Trisetum subg. Trisetum, and the other Calamagrostis/Deyeuxia p.p. (multiple species from Mexico to South America), Peyritschia, Leptophyllochloa, Sphenopholis, Trisetopsis and Trisetum subg. Deschampsioidea. Graphephorum, Trisetum cernuum, T. irazuense and T. macbridei fall in different clades of Koeleriinae in plastid vs. nuclear ribosomal trees, and are likely of hybrid origin. ITS and matK trees identify a third lineage of Koeleriinae corresponding to Trisetum subsect. Sibirica, and affinities of Lagurus ovatus with respect to Aveninae s.str. and Koeleriinae are incongruent in nuclear ribosomal and plastid trees, supporting recognition of Lagurus in its own subtribe. A large clade comprises taxa of Agrostidinae, Brizinae and Calothecinae, but neither Agrostidinae nor Calothecinae are monophyletic as currently circumscribed and affinities of Brizinae differ in plastid and nuclear ribosomal trees. Within this clade, one newly identified lineage comprises Calamagrostis coarctata, Dichelachne, Echinopogon (Agrostidinae p.p.) and Relchela (Calothecinae p.p.), and another comprises Chascolytrum (Calothecinae p.p.) and Deyeuxia effusa (Agrostidinae p.p.). Within Agrostidinae p.p., the type species of Deyeuxia and Calamagrostis s.str. are closely related, supporting classification of Deyeuxia as a synonym of Calamagrostis s.str. Furthermore, the two species of Ammophila are not sister taxa and are nested among different groups of Calamagrostis s.str., supporting their classification in Calamagrostis. Agrostis, Lachnagrostis and Polypogon form a clade and species of each are variously intermixed in plastid and nuclear ribosomal trees. Additionally, all but one species from South America classified in Deyeuxia sect. Stylagrostis resolve in Holcinae p.p. (Deschampsia). The current phylogenetic results support recognition of the latter species in Deschampsia, and we also demonstrate Scribneria is part of this clade. Moreover, Holcinae is not monophyletic in its current circumscription because Deschampsia does not form a clade with Holcus and Vahlodea, which are sister taxa. The results support recognition of Deschampsia in its own subtribe Aristaveninae. Substantial further changes to the classification of these grasses will be needed to produce generic circumscriptions consistent with phyloge etic evidence. The following 15 new combinations are made: Calamagrostis × calammophila, C. breviligulata, C. breviligulata subsp. champlainensis, C. × don-hensonii, Deschampsia aurea, D. bolanderi, D. chrysantha, D. chrysantha var. phalaroides, D. eminens, D. eminens var. fulva, D. eminens var. inclusa, D. hackelii, D. ovata, and D. ovata var. nivalis. D. podophora; the new name Deschampsia parodiana is proposed; the new subtribe Lagurinae is described; and a second-step lectotype is designated for the name Deyeuxia phalaroides.},

	abstract = {Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the origin of fleshy fruit in monocots. One is that they originated in the understory of tropical regions and another is that fleshy fruit originated in tropical rainforests where high year-round rainfall implies that seasonality is not a limiting factor. Here we identify the time of origin and ecological preferences of woody bamboos to understand the evolution of the fleshy fruit known as the bacoid caryopsis. Bayesian Inference, Maximum Likelihood and molecular dating analyses were run based on eight plastid and two nuclear regions for 68 bamboo species. Climate data and soil parameters were gathered for 464 localities for these species. The ancestral type of caryopsis was reconstructed by parsimony. According to these analyses the bacoid caryopsis may have evolved independently seven times from the Late Miocene to the Early Pliocene and Mid-Pliocene to Mid-Pleistocene via convergent evolution. Our results suggest that in bamboos neither current climatic variables nor soil parameters were significantly correlated with the appearance of this type of fruit, nor do they have a phylogenetic signal. It is remarkable, however, that the first appearance of the bacoid caryopsis in bamboos might be associated with historical preferences for warmer and wetter climate during the Miocene. Further research is needed to identify whether other factors, such as vivipary or dispersal by small animals, rather than climate, could be responsible for the evolution of this trait in woody bamboos.},

	abstract = {The Neotropical woody bamboo genus Otatea is one of five genera in the subtribe Guaduinae. Of the eight described Otatea species, seven are endemic to Mexico and one is also distributed in Central and South America. Otatea acuminata has the widest geographical distribution of the eight species, and two of its recently collected populations do not match the known species morphologically. Parametric and non-parametric methods were used to delimit the species in Otatea using five chloroplast markers, one nuclear marker, and morphological characters. The parametric coalescent method and the non-parametric analysis supported the recognition of two distinct evolutionary lineages. Molecular clock estimates were used to estimate divergence times in Otatea. The results for divergence time in Otatea estimated the origin of the speciation events from the Late Miocene to Late Pleistocene. The species delimitation analyses (parametric and non-parametric) identified that the two populations of O. acuminata from Chiapas and Hidalgo are from two separate evolutionary lineages and these new species have morphological characters that separate them from O. acuminata s.s. The geological activity of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec may have isolated populations and limited the gene flow between Otatea species, driving speciation. Based on the results found here, I describe Otatea rzedowskiorum and Otatea victoriae as two new species, morphologically different from O. acuminata.},

In such a context, the inference of phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic scenarios based on molecular data is easier using haploid markers like chloroplast genome sequences. Hybridization and polyploidization occurred recurrently in the genus Spartina (Poaceae, Chloridoideae), as illustrated by the recent formation of the invasive allododecaploid S. anglica during the 19th century in Europe. Until now, only a few plastid markers were available to explore the history of this genus and their low variability limited the resolution of species relationships. We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome (plastome) of S. maritima, the native European parent of S. anglica, and compared it to the plastomes of other Poaceae. Our analysis revealed the presence of fast-evolving regions of potential taxonomic, phylogeographic and phylogenetic utility at various levels within the Poaceae family. Using secondary calibrations, we show that the tetraploid and hexaploid lineages of Spartina diverged 6-10 my ago, and that the two parents of the invasive allopolyploid S. anglica separated 2-4 my ago via long distance dispersal of the ancestor of S. maritima over the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, we discuss the meaning of divergence times between chloroplast genomes in the context of reticulate evolution.},

The molecular mechanisms and genes involved in the DMSP biosynthesis pathways are still unknown. In this study, we performed comparative analyses of DMSP amounts and molecular phylogenetic analyses to decipher the origin of DMSP in Spartina that represents one of the major source of terrestrial DMSP in coastal marshes. DMSP content was explored in 14 Spartina species using 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Putative genes encoding the four enzymatic steps of the DMSP biosynthesis pathway in Spartina were examined and their evolutionary dynamics were studied. We found that the hexaploid lineage containing S. alterniflora, S. foliosa and S. maritima and their derived hybrids and allopolyploids are all able to produce DMSP, in contrast to species in the tetraploid clade. Thus, examination of DMSP synthesis in a phylogenetic context implicated a single origin of this physiological innovation, which occurred in the ancestor of the hexaploid Spartina lineage, 3-6MYA. Candidate genes specific to the Spartina DMSP biosynthesis pathway were also retrieved from Spartina transcriptomes, and provide a framework for future investigations to decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in this plant phenotypic novelty that has major ecological impacts in saltmarsh ecosystems.},

The plastid data identified a strongly supported core Aveneae lineage that separated from other former Aveneae and Poeae groups. Koeleriinae, Aveninae, and Agrostidinae emerged as the main groups of this core Aveneae, which also included other minor subgroups with uncertain relationships and a few former Poeae members. Several former Aveneae representatives were also placed in independent sublineages in Poeae. Seslerieae resolved as close allies of Poeae or Aveneae in the plastid and nuclear topologies, respectively. Because of the intermingling of some Aveneae and Seslerieae lineages in Poeae and vice versa, we propose to expand Poeae to include all the aforementioned lineages.

When conflict between gene trees is discovered, it is common practice either to analyze the data separately or to combine the data having excluded the conflicting taxa or data partitions for those taxa (which are then recoded as missing). We demonstrate an alternative approach, which involves duplicating conflicting taxa in the matrix, such that each duplicate is represented by one partition only. This allows the combination of all available data in standard phylogenetic analyses, despite reticulations. We show how interpretation of contradictory gene trees can lead to conflicting inferences of both morphological evolution and biogeographic history, using the example of the pampas grasses, Cortaderia. The characteristic morphological syndrome of Cortaderia can be inferred as having arisen multiple times (chloroplast DNA [cpDNA]) or just once (nuclear ribosomal DNA [nrDNA]). The distributions of species of Cortaderia and related genera in Australia/New Guinea, New Zealand, and South America can be explained by few (nrDNA) or several (cpDNA) dispersals between the southern continents. These contradictions can be explained by past hybridization events, which have linked gains of complex morphologies with unrelated chloroplast lineages and have erased evidence of dispersals from the nuclear genome. Given the discrepancies between inferences based on the gene trees individually, we urge the use of approaches such as ours that take multiple gene trees into account.},

Evolutionary relationships and a modern classification of Leptochloa spp. based on the study of molecular characters have only been superficially investigated in four species. The goals of this study were to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Leptochloa s.l. with molecular data and broad taxon sampling. METHODS A phylogenetic analysis was conducted of 130 species (mostly Chloridoideae), of which 22 are placed in Leptochloa, using five plastid (rpL32-trn-L, ndhA intron, rps16 intron, rps16-trnK and ccsA) and the nuclear ITS 1 and 2 (ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions) to infer evolutionary relationships and revise the classification. KEY RESULTS Leptochloa s.l. is polyphyletic and strong support was found for five lineages. Embedded within the Leptochloa sensu stricto (s.s.) clade are two Trichloris spp. and embedded in Dinebra are Drake-brockmania and 19 Leptochloa spp. CONCLUSIONS The molecular results support the dissolution of Leptochloa s.l. into the following five genera: Dinebra with 23 species, Diplachne with two species, Disakisperma with three species, Leptochloa s.s. with five species and a new genus, Trigonochloa, with two species.},

Muhlenbergiinae, the largest subtribe of C(4) grasses in Mexico and the southwestern United States (with 176 species), is taxonomically poorly understood. • METHODS We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 47 genera and 174 species using six plastid regions (ndhA intron, ndhF, rps16-trnK, rps16 intron, rps3, and rpl32-trnL) and the nuclear ITS 1 and 2 (ribosomal internal transcribed spacer) regions to infer evolutionary relationships and revise the classification. • KEY RESULTS In our analyses, Muhlenbergia (ca. 153 species) is paraphyletic, with nine genera (Aegopogon, Bealia, Blepharoneuron, Chaboissaea, Lycurus, Muhlenbergia, Pereilema, Redfieldia, Schaffnerella, and Schedonnardus) found nested within. We recognized the following five well-supported monophyletic lineages within Muhlenbergia: subg. Muhlenbergia, with species that have phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-like leaf anatomy and long, scaly rhizomes; subg. Trichochloa with long-lived species that are relatively tall (up to 3 m); subg. Clomena with 3-nerved upper glumes; sect. Pseudosporobolus species with narrow panicles and plumbeous spikelets; and sect. Bealia species with lemmas with hairy margins and midveins. • CONCLUSIONS We propose expanding the circumscription of Muhlenbergia to include the other nine genera in this subtribe and make the following new combinations: Muhlenbergia subg. Bealia, M. diandra, M. geminiflora, M. paniculata, M. phleoides, M. subg. Pseudosporobolus (also lectotipified), M. solisii, M. tricholepis. We also propose several new names: M. ammophila, M. columbi, M. plumosa. Our phylograms suggest that Muhlenbergia originated in North America because the sister (Sohnsia filifolia and Scleropogoninae) is composed of predominantly North American species.},

In our study the Cynodonteae still include 19 genera and the Zoysieae include a single genus that are not yet placed in a subtribe. The tribe Triraphideae and the subtribe Aeluropodinae are newly treated at that rank. We propose a new tribal and subtribal classification for all known genera in the Chloridoideae. The subfamily might have originated in Africa and/or Asia since the basal lineage, the Triraphideae, includes species with African and Asian distribution.},

	abstract = {Although much of extant diversity is probably the product of evolutionary radiations, the special case of adaptive radiations has not yet been thoroughly explored. Adaptive radiations are postulated to occur when a lineage is exposed to new ecological opportunities, where it can diversify ecologically. We argue that adaptive radiations have two characteristics. Firstly, the diversification rate accelerates initially, and is then followed by a density-dependent slow-down. Secondly, traits relevant to the new ecological opportunity should evolve at or just before the radiation. We also argue that a correct identification of adaptive radiations is dependent on the phylogenies underlying the diversification dynamics being sampled adequately (i.e. comprehensive species sampling), and that the traits should be treated continuously if they exhibit a biological continuum and not be over-simplified into binary traits. Here, we test the hypothesis that much of the extant diversity of the south-temperate grass subfamily Danthonioideae is the result of two geographically separated but contemporaneous adaptive radiations, in response to Late-Miocene-Pliocene aridification and increasingly seasonal climates. We show that both Pentameris (83 African species) and Rytidosperma (73 Australasian-South American species) exhibit accelerations in diversification rates followed by linear density-dependent declines. We also show that two selected traits show differential evolutionary regimes with different evolutionary optima, and that these are linked to changes in the diversification rate. These results are consistent with these being adaptive, and putatively parallel, radiations. However, by mapping traits over the whole danthonioid phylogeny, it is evident that no identified trait or trait combination is sufficient and necessary for adaptive radiations. Furthermore, we show that simplifying the traits to binary gives a strong but potentially erroneous link between trait shift and diversification rate shift.},

The sequences were analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Both the individual and combined analyses of ITS and trnD-trnT supported Olyreae as a monophyletic group. All species of Raddia also formed a well-supported monophyletic group, and combined datasets allowed us to outline some relationships within this group.

However, the combined analysis supported Sucrea as sister to Raddia, although the monophyly of Sucrea is not well supported. Parodiolyra is paraphyletic to Raddiella in all analyses; Olyra is also paraphyletic, with species of Lithachne, Arberella and Cryptochloa nested within it.

A better understanding of the phylogeny in the genus Sorghum will enhance use of the valuable agronomic traits found in wild sorghum. METHODS Four regions of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA; psbZ-trnG, trnY-trnD, trnY-psbM and trnT-trnL) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA were used to analyse the phylogeny of sorghum based on maximum-parsimony analyses. KEY RESULTS Parsimony analyses of the ITS and cpDNA regions as separate or combined sequence datasets formed trees with strong bootstrap support with two lineages: the Eu-sorghum species S. laxiflorum and S. macrospermum in one and Stiposorghum and Para-sorghum in the other. Within Eu-sorghum, S. bicolor-3, -11 and -14 originating from southern Africa form a distinct clade. S. bicolor-2, originally from Yemen, is distantly related to other S. bicolor accessions. CONCLUSIONS Eu-sorghum species are more closely related to S. macrospermum and S. laxiflorum than to any other Australian wild Sorghum species. S. macrospermum and S. laxiflorum are so closely related that it is inappropriate to classify them in separate sections. S. almum is closely associated with S. bicolor, suggesting that the latter is the maternal parent of the former given that cpDNA is maternally inherited in angiosperms. S. bicolor-3, -11 and -14, from southern Africa, are closely related to each other but distantly related to S. bicolor-2.},

Separate and combined data sets were analyzed using parsimony, distance, and likelihood based methods, including Bayesian. Data congruence was examined using character and topological measures. Significant data heterogeneity was detected, but there was little conflict in the topological substructure measures for triplets and quartets, and resolution and clade support increased in the combined analysis. Data incongruence may be a result of noise and insufficient information in the slower evolving trnT-trnF. Monophyly of Eleusine is strongly supported in all analyses, but basal relationships in the genus remain uncertain. There is good support for a CAIK clade (E. coracana subsp. coracana and africana, E. indica, and E. kigeziensis), with E. tristachya as its sister group. Two putative ITS homeologues (A and B loci) were identified in the allotetraploid E. coracana; the 'B' locus sequence type was not found in the remaining species. Eleusine coracana and its putative 'A' genome donor, the diploid E. indica, are confirmed close allies, but sequence data contradicts the hypothesis that E. floccifolia is its second genome donor. The 'B' genome donor remains unidentified and may be extinct.},

This species is one of four of Anomochlooideae, the crown node of which diverged before those of any other grass subfamily. The plastome was sequenced from overlapping amplicons using previously designed primers. The plastome of A. marantoidea is 138412 bp long with a typical gene content for Poaceae. Five regions were examined in detail because of prior surveys that identified structural alterations among graminoid Poales. Anomochloa marantoidea was found to have an intron in rpoC1, unlike other Poaceae. The insertion region of rpoC2 is unusually short in A. marantoidea compared with those of other grasses, but with atypically long subrepeats. Both ycf1 and ycf2 are nonfunctional as is typical in grasses, but A. marantoidea has a uniquely long ψycf1. Finally, the rbcL-psaI spacer in A. marantoidea is atypically short with no evidence of the ψrpl23 locus found in all other Poaceae. Some of these features are of noteworthy dissimilarity between A. marantoidea and those crown grasses for which entire plastomes have been sequenced. Complete plastome sequences of other Anomochlooideae and outgroups will further advance our understanding of the evolutionary events in the plastome that accompanied graminoid diversification.},

	abstract = {Polyploidy has been ubiquitous in plant evolution and is thought to be an important engine of biodiversity that facilitates speciation, adaptation, and range expansion. Polyploid species can exhibit higher ecological tolerance than their progenitor species. For allotetraploid species, this higher tolerance is often attributed to the existence of heterosis resulting from entire genome duplication. However, multiple origins of allopolyploid species may further promote their ecological success by providing genetic variability in ecological traits underlying local adaptation and range expansion. Here we show in a group of allopolyploid species in the genus Aegilops that range size and abundance are correlated with the number of inferred origins. We found that allopolyploid Aegilops spp. contain multiple chloroplast haplotypes, each identical to haplotypes of the diploid progenitor species, indicating multiple origins as the major source of variation. The number of inferred origins in each allopolyploid species was correlated to the total area occupied by the allopolyploid and the tendency for the species to be common. Additionally, we found differences in ecological tolerance among independent origins in Aegilops triuncialis. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the introduction of genetic variability by multiple origins can increase the ecological amplitude and evolutionary success of allopolyploid species.},

First, a phylogenetic analysis of coding sequences from wheat, barley, rye, rice, and corn was expected to clarify the relationship between the endosperm-specific and tissue-ubiquitous forms of the protein. Instead, it illustrates possible effects of distant outgroups, based on conflicting patterns of character state variation consistent with different root positions. Next, a broad sample of the monogenomic Triticeae was included in a phylogenetic analysis based on sequences from a portion of the tissue-ubiquitous β-amylase gene. The results were compared to existing Triticeae gene trees, among which extensive conflict had been noted in the past. One additional gene tree has not completely clarified the complexity of the group, but has shed additional light on reticulate phylogenetic patterns within the tribe, including relationships involving Eremopyrum, Thinopyrum, and the Triticum/Aegilops group.},

Most Pong elements contain two open reading frames (ORFs). One encodes a transposase (ORF2) that catalyzes transposition of Pong and related non-autonomous elements, while the function of the second is unknown. Little is known about the evolutionary history of Pong elements in flowering plants. In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the diversity, abundance, and evolution of the Pong-like transposase gene in the genomes of 21 diploid species from the wheat tribe, Triticeae, and we present the first convincing evidence of horizontal transfer of nuclear-encoded Pong elements in any organism. A phylogenetic analysis of nearly 300 Pong sequences based on a conserved region of the transposase domain revealed a complex evolutionary history of Pong elements that can be best explained by ancestral polymorphism, followed by differential evolutionary success of some transposase lineages, and by occasional horizontal transfer between phylogenetically distant genera. In addition, we used transposon display to estimate the abundance of the transposase gene within Triticeae genomes, and our results revealed varying levels of Pong proliferation, with numbers of transposase copies ranging from 22 to 92. Comparisons of Pong transposase abundance to flow cytometry estimates of genome size revealed that larger Triticeae genome size was not correlated with transposase abundance.},

	abstract = {To estimate the phylogenetic relationship of polyploid Elymus in Triticeae, nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplast trnL-F sequences of 45 Elymus accessions containing various genomes were analysed with those of five Pseudoroegneria (St), two Hordeum (H), three Agropyron (P) and two Australopyrum (W) accessions. The ITS sequences revealed a close phylogenetic relationship between the polyploid Elymus and species from the other genera. The ITS and trnL-F trees indicated considerable differentiation of the StY genome species. The trnL-F sequences revealed an especially close relationship of Pseudoroegneria to all Elymus species included. Both the ITS and trnL-F trees suggested multiple origins and recurrent hybridization of Elymus species. The results suggested that: the St, H, P, and W genomes in polyploid Elymus were donated by Pseudoroegneria, Hordeum, Agropyron and Australopyrum, respectively, and the St and Y genomes may have originated from the same ancestor; Pseudoroegneria was the maternal donor of the polyploid Elymus; and some Elymus species showed multiple origin and experienced recurrent hybridization.},

	abstract = {Bamboos are large perennial grasses of temperate and tropical forests worldwide. Two general growth forms exist: the economically and ecologically important woody bamboos (tribes Arundinarieae and Bambuseae), and the understory herbaceous bamboos (tribe Olyreae). Evolutionary relationships among the 1400+described species have been difficult to resolve with confidence. Comparative analysis of bamboo plastid (chloroplast) DNA has revealed three to five major lineages that show distinct biogeographic distributions. Taxon sampling across tribes and subtribes has been incomplete and most published data sets include a relatively small number of nucleotide characters. Branching order among lineages is often poorly supported, and in more than one study herbaceous bamboos form a clade within the woody bamboos. In this paper, the Bamboo Phylogeny Group presents the most complete phylogeny estimation to date of bamboo tribes and subtribes using 6.7 kb of coding and noncoding sequence data and 37 microstructural characters from the chloroplast genome. Quality of data is assessed, as is the possibility of long branch attraction, the degree of character conflict at key nodes in the tree, and the legitimacy of three alternative hypotheses of relationship. Four major plastid lineages are recognized: temperate woody, paleotropical woody, neotropical woody, and herbaceous bamboos. Woody bamboos are resolved as paraphyletic with respect to Olyreae but SH tests cannot reject monophyly of woody species (Arundinarieae+Bambuseae).},

DNA sequencing, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and chromosome studies confirm that M. ×giganteus is an allotriploid (2n = 3x = 57) combining genomes from M. sinensis (2n = 2x = 38) and M. sacchariflorus (2n = 38 or 76). Two alleles of the internal transcribed spacer of 18S-25S nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) were discovered in polymerase chain reaction products of M. ×giganteus. Cloning of these revealed that one matched M. sinensis and the other M. sacchariflorus. Plastid trnL intron and trnL-F spacer sequences showed that the maternal lineage of M. ×giganteus was M. sacchariflorus. Fluorescent in situ hybridization, FISH, was used to investigate genome organization in Miscanthus but was unable to differentiate between the different parental genomes present in M. ×giganteus, indicating that two parental genomes are still extremely similar at the repetitive DNA level. This study is an example in which rDNA sequences and AFLP fingerprints permit identification of the parental genomes in a hybrid, but FISH methods, at the repetitive DNA level (including genomic in situ hybridization, GISH), were unable to do so because their sequences remain too similar.},

Three DNA regions were sequenced, including the trnLintron and the trnL-F intergenic spacer of the plastid genome and the ITS region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA). Because it was more variable, the ITS region proved most suitable for phylogenetic reconstruction at this level, and the results indicate that Miscanthus s.l. and Saccharum s.l. are polyphyletic. A set of species from Saccharum section Ripidium(clade a) do not group closely with any members of Saccharum s.l. A number of Miscanthus species from eastern or south-eastern Asia represent a monophyletic group with a basic chromosome number of 19 (clade b), but the other species from Africa and the Himalayas are clearly excluded. There is support for a monophyletic Saccharum s.s. clade including S. officinarumand S. spontaneum that is sister to Miscanthus s.s(clade c). There is no evidence to support the division of some Saccharum s.l. into the genera currently known as Erianthus and Narenga. Saccharum contortum( =Erianthus contortus), S. narenga (= Narenga porphyrocoma) and Erianthus rockii, group more closely with Miscanthus fuscus, a species from the Himalayas and also with the African Miscanthus s.l. species (= Miscanthidium, clade d).},

	abstract = {To investigate phylogenetic relationships within the grass subfamily Pooideae we studied about 50 taxa covering all recognized tribes, using one plastid DNA (cpDNA) marker (matK gene-3'trnK exon) and for the first time four nuclear single copy gene loci. DNA sequence information from two parts of the nuclear genes topoisomerase 6 (Topo6) spanning the exons 8-13 and 17-19, the exons 9-13 encoding plastid acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (Acc1) and the partial exon 1 of phytochrome B (PhyB) were generated. Individual and nuclear combined data were evaluated using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. All of the phylogenetic results show Brachyelytrum and the tribe Nardeae as earliest diverging lineages within the subfamily. The 'core' Pooideae (Hordeeae and the Aveneae/Poeae tribe complex) are also strongly supported, as well as the monophyly of the tribes Brachypodieae, Meliceae and Stipeae (except PhyB). The beak grass tribe Diarrheneae and the tribe Duthieeae are not monophyletic in some of the analyses. However, the combined nuclear DNA (nDNA) tree yields the highest resolution and the best delimitation of the tribes, and provides the following evolutionary hypothesis for the tribes: Brachyelytrum, Nardeae, Duthieeae, Meliceae, Stipeae, Diarrheneae, Brachypodieae and the 'core' Pooideae. Within the individual datasets, the phylogenetic trees obtained from Topo6 exon 8-13 shows the most interesting results. The divergent positions of some clone sequences of Ampelodesmos mauritanicus and Trikeraia pappiformis, for instance, may indicate a hybrid origin of these stipoid taxa.},

The clade comprises 82 species in three genera, Pentaschistis, Pentameris, and Prionanthium. We demonstrate that Prionanthium is nested in Pentaschistis and that this clade is sister to a clade of Pentameris plus Pentaschistis tysonii. Forty-three of the species in the Pentaschistis clade have multicellular glands and we use ancestral character state reconstruction to show that they have been gained twice or possibly once, and lost several times. We suggest that the maintenance, absence, loss, and gain of glands are correlated with leaf anatomy type, and additionally that there is a difference in the degree of diversification of lineages that have these different character combinations. We propose that both glands and sclerophyllous leaves act as defense systems against herbivory, and build a cost/benefit model in which multicellular glands or sclerophyllous leaves are lost when the alternative defense system evolves. We also investigate the association between leaf anatomy type and soil nutrient type on which species grow. There is little phylogenetic constraint in soil nutrient type on members of the Pentaschistis clade, with numerous transitions between oligotrophic and eutrophic soils. However, only orthophyllous-leaved species diversify on eutrophic soils. We suggest that the presence of these glands enables the persistence of orthophyllous lineages and therefore diversification of the Pentaschistis clade on eutrophic as well as oligotrophic soils.},

This group of annual species native from the Old-World is composed of three diploids, two tetraploids, one hexaploid, and one octoploid. Molecular cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses were performed on several accessions per species. We used the low copy nuclear gene Waxy, repeated rDNA spacers ITS1 and ITS2 and chloroplast spacers trnT-trnL and trnL-trnF. Our analyses revealed four different lineages involved in the parentage of the polyploids and confirmed their reticulate origin. Three of these lineages are closely related to the diploid species B. sterilis, B. tectorum, and B. fasciculatus. The fourth lineage could not be related to any diploid according to the available data. Our data gave insights on the origin of all the polyploids of section Genea, and chloroplast data allowed us to identify the maternal lineages. The Waxy gene was the most informative regarding origin of the polyploids. The Waxy copies duplicated by polyploidy appear selectively maintained in the polyploid species. No sequence heterogeneity was encountered in the ITS region, where concerted evolution seems to have occurred toward either maternal or paternal repeats. These results provide new information about the origin and molecular evolution of these polyploids and will allow a more accurate taxonomic treatment of the concerned species, based on their evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {Chloridoideae (chloridoid grasses) are a subfamily of ca. 1700 species with high diversity in arid habitats. Until now, their evolutionary relationships have primarily been studied with DNA sequences from the chloroplast, a maternally inherited organelle. Next-generation sequencing is able to efficiently recover large numbers of nuclear loci that can then be used to estimate the species phylogeny based upon bi-parentally inherited data. We sought to test our chloroplast-based hypotheses of relationships among chloridoid species with 122 nuclear loci generated through targeted-enrichment next-generation sequencing, sometimes referred to as hyb-seq. We targeted putative single-copy housekeeping genes, as well as genes that have been implicated in traits characteristic of, or particularly labile in, chloridoids: e.g., drought and salt tolerance. We recovered ca. 70\% of the targeted loci (122 of 177 loci) in all 47 species sequenced using hyb-seq. We then analyzed the nuclear loci with Bayesian and coalescent methods and the resulting phylogeny resolves relationships between the four chloridoid tribes. Several novel findings with this data were: the sister lineage to Chloridoideae is unresolved; Centropodia+Ellisochloa are excluded from Chloridoideae in phylogenetic estimates using a coalescent model; Sporobolus subtilis is more closely related to Eragrostis than to other species of Sporobolus; and Tragus is more closely related to Chloris and relatives than to a lineage of mainly New World species. Relationships in Cynodonteae in the nuclear phylogeny are quite different from chloroplast estimates, but were not robust to changes in the method of phylogenetic analysis. We tested the data signal with several partition schemes, a concatenation analysis, and tests of alternative hypotheses to assess our confidence in this new, nuclear estimate of evolutionary relationships. Our work provides markers and a framework for additional phylogenetic studies that sample more densely within chloridoid tribes. These results represent progress towards a robust classification of this important subfamily of grasses, as well as proof-of-concept for hyb-seq next-generation sequencing as a method to generate sequences for phylogenetic analyses in grasses and other plant families.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Single- and low- copy genes are less likely subject to concerted evolution, thus making themselves ideal tools for studying the origin and evolution of polyploid taxa. Leymus is a polyploid genus with a diverse array of morphology, ecology and distribution in Triticeae. The genomic constitution of Leymus was assigned as NsXm, where Ns was presumed to be originated from Psathyrostachys, while Xm represented a genome of unknown origin. In addition, little is known about the evolutionary history of Leymus. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic relationship, genome donor, and evolutionary history of Leymus based on a single-copy nuclear Acc1 gene. RESULTS Two homoeologues of the Acc1 gene were isolated from nearly all the sampled Leymus species using allele-specific primer and were analyzed with those from 35 diploid taxa representing 18 basic genomes in Triticeae. Sequence diversity patterns and genealogical analysis suggested that (1) Leymus is closely related to Psathyrostachys, Agropyron, and Eremopyrum; (2) Psathyrostachys juncea is an ancestral Ns-genome donor of Leymus species; (3) the Xm genome in Leymus may be originated from an ancestral lineage of Agropyron and Eremopyrum triticeum; (4) the Acc1 sequences of Leymus species from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are evolutionarily distinct; (5) North America Leymus species might originate from colonization via the Bering land bridge; (6) Leymus originated about 11-12MYA in Eurasia, and adaptive radiation might have occurred in Leymus during the period of 3.7-4.3 MYA and 1.7-2.1 MYA. CONCLUSION Leymus species have allopolyploid origin. It is hypothesized that the adaptive radiation of Leymus species might have been triggered by the recent upliftings of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and subsequent climatic oscillations. Adaptive radiation may have promoted the rapid speciation, as well as the fixation of unique morphological characters in Leymus. Our results shed new light on our understanding of the origin of Xm genome, the polyploidization events and evolutionary history of Leymus that could account for the rich diversity and ecological adaptation of Leymus species.},

The early divergence of the Eurasiatic species (B. media, B. maxima and B. minor), and the monophyly of the South American group (including Erianthecium, Rhombolytrum and Gymnachne) support Briza L. sensu stricto, and a single genus for the American group.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-11-181},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND Introgressive events (e.g., hybridization, gene flow, horizontal gene transfer) and incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms are a challenge for phylogenetic analyses since different genes may exhibit conflicting genealogical histories. Grasses of the Triticeae tribe provide a particularly striking example of incongruence among gene trees. Previous phylogenies, mostly inferred with one gene, are in conflict for several taxon positions. Therefore, obtaining a resolved picture of relationships among genera and species of this tribe has been a challenging task. Here, we obtain the most comprehensive molecular dataset to date in Triticeae, including one chloroplastic and 26 nuclear genes. We aim to test whether it is possible to infer phylogenetic relationships in the face of (potentially) large-scale introgressive events and/or incomplete lineage sorting; to identify parts of the evolutionary history that have not evolved in a tree-like manner; and to decipher the biological causes of gene-tree conflicts in this tribe. RESULTS We obtain resolved phylogenetic hypotheses using the supermatrix and Bayesian Concordance Factors (BCF) approaches despite numerous incongruences among gene trees. These phylogenies suggest the existence of 4-5 major clades within Triticeae, with Psathyrostachys and Hordeum being the deepest genera. In addition, we construct a multigenic network that highlights parts of the Triticeae history that have not evolved in a tree-like manner. Dasypyrum, Heteranthelium and genera of clade V, grouping Secale, Taeniatherum, Triticum and Aegilops, have evolved in a reticulated manner. Their relationships are thus better represented by the multigenic network than by the supermatrix or BCF trees. Noteworthy, we demonstrate that gene-tree incongruences increase with genetic distance and are greater in telomeric than centromeric genes. Together, our results suggest that recombination is the main factor decoupling gene trees from multigenic trees. CONCLUSIONS Our study is the first to propose a comprehensive, multigenic phylogeny of Triticeae. It clarifies several aspects of the relationships among genera and species of this tribe, and pinpoints biological groups with likely reticulate evolution. Importantly, this study extends previous results obtained in Drosophila by demonstrating that recombination can exacerbate gene-tree conflicts in phylogenetic reconstructions.},

Eight distinct annual lineages, that have traditionally been placed in the genus Vulpia and in other fine-leaved ephemeral genera, have apparently emerged from different perennial Festuca ancestors. The phenotypically similar Vulpia taxa have been reconstructed as polyphyletic, with polyploid lineages showing unclear relationships to their purported diploid relatives. Interspecific and intergeneric hybridization is, however, rampant across different lineages. An evolutionary analysis based on cloned nuclear low-copy GBSSI (Granule-Bound Starch Synthase I) and multicopy ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) sequences has been conducted on representatives of most Vulpia species and other fine-leaved lineages, using Bayesian consensus and agreement trees, networking split graphs and species tree-based approaches, to disentangle their phylogenetic relationships and to identify the parental genome donors of the allopolyploids. Both data sets were able to reconstruct a congruent phylogeny in which Vulpia was resolved as polyphyletic from at least three main ancestral diploid lineages. These, in turn, participated in the origin of the derived allopolyploid Vulpia lineages together with other Festuca-like, Psilurus-like and some unknown genome donors. Long-distance dispersal events were inferred to explain the polytopic origin of the Mediterranean and American Vulpia lineages.},

The termini of ndhH and ndhF, situated near opposite ends of the small single-copy region (SSC) in the plastid genomes of grasses (Poaceae), have migrated repeatedly into and out of the adjacent inverted-repeat regions (IR). The two genes are transcribed in the same direction, and the 5' terminus of ndhH extends into the IR in some species, while the 3' terminus of ndhF extends into the IR in others. When both genes extend into the IR, portions of the genes overlap and are encoded by the same nucleotide positions. Fine-scale mapping of the SSC-IR junctions across a sample of 92 grasses and outgroups, integrated into a phylogenetic analysis, indicates that the earliest grasses resembled the related taxa Joinvillea (Joinvilleaceae) and Ecdeiocolea (Ecdeiocoleaceae), with ca. 180 nucleotides of ndhH extending into the IR, and with ndhF confined to the SSC. This structure is maintained in early-diverging grass lineages and in most species of the BEP clade. In the PACMAD clade, ndhH lies completely or nearly completely within the SSC, and ca. 20 nucleotides of ndhF extend into the IR. The nucleotide substitution rate has increased in the PACMAD clade in the portion of ndhH that has migrated into the SSC.},

We analyzed noncoding nuclear and chloroplast DNA of all North American diploid Puccinellia (Poaceae) and a subset of arctic polyploids to hypothesize evolutionary relationships among diploids and to evaluate the parentage of polyploids. Diploids formed three lineages: one uniting arctic species P. arctica and P. banksiensis; a second comprising arctic species P. tenella, P. alaskana, P. vahliana, and P. wrightii; and a third uniting the two temperate species P. lemmonii and P. parishii. The arctic species P. angustata (hexaploid) and P. andersonii (primarily octoploid) apparently derive from the P. arctica-P. banksiensis lineage based on ITS and chloroplast sequences, and share an ancestor with arctic triploid/tetraploid P. phryganodes based on nrDNA sequences. Sequence comparisons also suggest tetraploid P. bruggemannii evolved from two arctic lineages: P. vahliana-P. wrightii and P. arctica-P. banksiensis. These patterns and the predominance of arctic rather than temperate diploid species support the idea that diploid Puccinellia recolonized the Arctic from northern glacial refugia like Beringia, and also formed stabilized polyploid hybrids during these refugial events or subsequently during postglacial colonization.},

	abstract = {Determining the number of evolutions of an adaptive novelty is primordial to understand its evolutionary significance. C(4) photosynthesis, an adaptation to low CO(2) atmospheric concentration and high temperature, evolved multiple times, but the number of convergent evolutions is still debated. In Poaceae phylogeny, numerous C(4) groups are separated by C(3) taxa, but whether these correspond to independent C(4) origins or a few C(4) evolutions followed by reversals is controversial. The Aristidoideae subfamily is formed by two C(4) genera, Aristida and Stipagrostis, separated by the C(3) genus Sartidia. In the current study, we investigated the evolutionary history of genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases (PEPC) to shed light on the photosynthetic transitions that occurred in Aristidoideae. We identified six distinct PEPC gene lineages that appeared through several rounds of gene duplications before or early during grass diversification. The gene lineage encoding the C(4) PEPC of Stipagrostis differs from those of the other C(4) grasses, including Aristida. These distinct origins of C(4) PEPC genes from these two Aristidoideae genera unequivocally indicate that they integrated the C(4) pathway independently. This highlights the importance of candidate-gene studies when inferring the evolutionary history of a character such as C(4) photosynthesis, one of the greatest evolutionary successes in plant history.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS Twenty-five genera having sterile inflorescence branches were recognized as the bristle clade within the x = 9 Paniceae (Panicoideae). Within the bristle clade, taxonomic circumscription of Cenchrus (20-25 species), Pennisetum (80-140) and the monotypic Odontelytrum is still unclear. Several criteria have been applied to characterize Cenchrus and Pennisetum, but none of these has proved satisfactory as the diagnostic characters, such as fusion of bristles in the inflorescences, show continuous variation. METHODS A phylogenetic analysis based on morphological, plastid (trnL-F, ndhF) and nuclear (knotted) data is presented for a representative species sampling of the genera. All analyses were conducted under parsimony, using heuristic searches with TBR branch swapping. Branch support was assessed with parsimony jackknifing. KEY RESULTS Based on plastid and morphological data, Pennisetum, Cenchrus and Odontelytrum were supported as a monophyletic group: the PCO clade. Only one section of Pennisetum (Brevivalvula) was supported as monophyletic. The position of P. lanatum differed among data partitions, although the combined plastid and morphology and nuclear analyses showed this species to be a member of the PCO clade. The basic chromosome number x = 9 was found to be plesiomorphic, and x = 5, 7, 8, 10 and 17 were derived states. The nuclear phylogenetic analysis revealed a reticulate pattern of relationships among Pennisetum and Cenchrus, suggesting that there are at least three different genomes. Because apomixis can be transferred among species through hybridization, its history most likely reflects crossing relationships, rather than multiple independent appearances. CONCLUSIONS Due to the consistency between the present results and different phylogenetic hypotheses (including morphological, developmental and multilocus approaches), and the high support found for the PCO clade, also including the type species of the three genera, we propose unification of Pennisetum, Cenchrus and Odontelytrum. Species of Pennisetum and Odontelytrum are here transferred into Cenchrus, which has priority. Sixty-six new combinations are made here.},

	abstract = {PREMISE The cosmopolitan and ecologically important grass subfamily Aristidoideae comprises the widely distributed genus Aristida (250-290 species), Stipagrostis (50 species, with an African-Asian distribution), and Sartidia (five species, Africa and Madagascar). The subfamily includes species with C(3) (Sartidia and a single species of Aristida) and C(4) photosynthetic pathways. Rigorous phylogenetic reconstructions of species relationships are required to explain the biogeographic, physiological, and ecological diversity within this subfamily. METHODS Chloroplast (trnL-F, rpl16) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences were obtained from 198 accessions, and the combined data set was subjected to parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses. Dating analyses calibrated using previously published node ages were conducted to determine the ages of major radiations. RESULTS The C(3) Sartidia is sister to a monophyletic Stipagrostis, and the (Sartidia, Stipagrostis) clade is sister to Aristida. Within Aristida, the only known C(3) species, A. longifolia, is sister to the remainder of the genus. Infrageneric sections of Aristida were not supported, and there are no synapomorphic morphological characters for the clades retrieved. Within Aristida, monophyletic Australian, African, North American, and South American clades are retrieved. CONCLUSIONS The subfamily dates back to the late Miocene, with the major lineages present by the Pliocene. With one exception, regional clades of Aristida evolved in the Pliocene. The C(3) photosynthetic pathway is hypothesized to be the pleisomorphic condition for the subfamily, wherein two independent C(4) pathways (each with unique anatomical and genetic features) evolved, one within Aristida and one in Stipagrostis.},

Complete plastome sequences have been previously determined and analyzed for nine bambusoid species that exclusively represent Old World lineages. The addition of New World species provides more complete information on relationships within Bambusoideae. • METHODS Plastomes from A. gigantea and C. strictiflora were sequenced using Sanger methods. Phylogenomic and divergence estimate analyses were conducted on both species with 23 other Poaceae. • KEY RESULTS Phylogenomic and divergence analyses suggested that A. gigantea diverged from within Arundinarieae between 1.94-3.92 mya and that C. strictiflora diverged as the sister to tropical woody species between 24.83 and 40.22 mya. These results are correlated with modern relative diversities in the two lineages. • CONCLUSIONS The two New World bamboos show unique plastome features accumulated and maintained in biogeographic isolation from Old World taxa. The overall evidence for A. gigantea is consistent with recent dispersal, and that for C. strictiflora is consistent with vicariance.},

	abstract = {Polyploidization is an important speciation mechanism in the barley genus Hordeum. To analyze evolutionary changes after allopolyploidization, knowledge of parental relationships is essential. One chloroplast and 12 nuclear single-copy loci were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all Hordeum plus six out-group species. Amplicons from each of 96 individuals were pooled, sheared, labeled with individual-specific barcodes and sequenced in a single run on a 454 platform. Reference sequences were obtained by cloning and Sanger sequencing of all loci for nine supplementary individuals. The 454 reads were assembled into contigs representing the 13 loci and, for polyploids, also homoeologues. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted for all loci separately and for a concatenated data matrix of all loci. For diploid taxa, a Bayesian concordance analysis and a coalescent-based dated species tree was inferred from all gene trees. Chloroplast matK was used to determine the maternal parent in allopolyploid taxa. The relative performance of different multilocus analyses in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization was also assessed. The resulting multilocus phylogeny reveals for the first time species phylogeny and progenitor-derivative relationships of all di- and polyploid Hordeum taxa within a single analysis. Our study proves that it is possible to obtain a multilocus species-level phylogeny for di- and polyploid taxa by combining PCR with next-generation sequencing, without cloning and without creating a heavy load of sequence data.},

Phylogenetic inference was based on three plastid DNA regions rbcL, matK and trnL-F, using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods. Our results resolved most of the subfamily relationships within the major clades (BEP and PACCMAD), which had previously been unclear, such as, among others the: (i) BEP and PACCMAD sister relationship, (ii) composition of clades and the sister-relationship of Ehrhartoideae and Bambusoideae + Pooideae, (iii) paraphyly of tribe Bambuseae, (iv) position of Gynerium as sister to Panicoideae, (v) phylogenetic position of Micrairoideae. With the presence of a relatively large amount of missing data, we were able to increase taxon sampling substantially in our analyses from 107 to 295 taxa. However, bootstrap support and to a lesser extent Bayesian inference posterior probabilities were generally lower in analyses involving missing data than those not including them. We produced a fully resolved phylogenetic summary tree for the grass family at subfamily level and indicated the most likely relationships of all included tribes in our analysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS An accurate characterization of biodiversity requires analyses of DNA sequences in addition to classical morphological descriptions. New methods based on high-throughput sequencing may allow investigation of specimens with a large set of genetic markers to infer their evolutionary history. In the grass family, the phylogenetic position of the monotypic genus Lecomtella, a rare bamboo-like endemic from Madagascar, has never been appropriately evaluated. Until now its taxonomic treatment has remained controversial, indicating the need for re-evaluation based on a combination of molecular and morphological data. METHODS The phylogenetic position of Lecomtella in Poaceae was evaluated based on sequences from the nuclear and plastid genomes generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In addition, a detailed morphological description of L. madagascariensis was produced, and its distribution and habit were investigated in order to assess its conservation status. KEY RESULTS The complete plastid sequence, a ribosomal DNA unit and fragments of low-copy nuclear genes (phyB and ppc) were obtained. All phylogenetic analyses place Lecomtella as an isolated member of the core panicoids, which last shared a common ancestor with other species {\textgreater}20 million years ago. Although Lecomtella exhibits morphological characters typical of Panicoideae, an unusual combination of traits supports its treatment as a separate group. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that NGS can be used to generate abundant phylogenetic information rapidly, opening new avenues for grass phylogenetics. These data clearly showed that Lecomtella forms an isolated lineage, which, in combination with its morphological peculiarities, justifies its treatment as a separate tribe: Lecomtelleae. New descriptions of the tribe, genus and species are presented with a typification, a distribution map and an IUCN conservation assessment.},

A representative sample of 28 taxa was used and maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses were conducted to estimate the Arundinarieae phylogeny. All the previously recognized clades of Arundinarieae were supported, with Ampelocalamus calcareus (Clade XI) as sister to the rest of the temperate woody bamboos. Well supported sister relationships between Bergbambos tessellata (Clade I) and Thamnocalamus spathiflorus (Clade VII) and between Kuruna (Clade XII) and Chimonocalmus (Clade III) were revealed by the current study. The plastome topology was tested by taxon removal experiments and alternative hypothesis testing and the results supported the current plastome phylogeny as robust. Neighbor-net analyses showed few phylogenetic signal conflicts, but suggested some potentially complex relationships among these taxa. Analyses of morphological character evolution of rhizomes and reproductive structures revealed that pachymorph rhizomes were most likely the ancestral state in Arundinarieae. In contrast leptomorph rhizomes either evolved once with reversions to the pachymorph condition or multiple times in Arundinarieae. Further, pseudospikelets evolved independently at least twice in the Arundinarieae, but the ancestral state is ambiguous.},

Understanding the evolutionary history of groups of organisms or regional biotas such as the Australian arid biota requires clear delimitation of the units of biodiversity (taxa). Here we integrate evidence from nuclear (ETS and ITS) and chloroplast (rps16-trnK spacer) regions and morphology to clarify taxonomic boundaries in a species complex of Australian hummock grasses (Triodia) to better understand the evolution of Australian arid zone plants and to evaluate congruence in distribution patterns with co-occurring organisms. We find evidence for multiple new taxa in the T. basedowii species complex, but also incongruence between data sets and indications of hybridization that complicate delimitation. We find that the T. basedowii complex has high lineage diversity and endemism in the biologically important Pilbara region of Western Australia, consistent with the region acting as a refugium. Taxa show strong geographic structure in the Pilbara, congruent with recent work on co-occurring animals and suggesting common evolutionary drivers across the biota. Our findings confirm recognition of the Pilbara as an important centre of biodiversity in the Australian arid zone, and provide a basis for future taxonomic revision of the T. basedowii complex and more detailed study of its evolutionary history and that of arid Australia.},

	abstract = {Panicum L. is a cosmopolitan genus with approximately 450 species. Although the genus has been considerably reduced in species number with the segregation of many taxa to independent genera in the last two centuries, Panicum remains a heterogeneous assemblage, as has been demonstrated in recent years. The genus is remarkably uniform in its floral characters but exhibits considerable variation in anatomical, physiological, and cytological features. As a result, several classifications, and criteria of what the genus should really include, have been postulated in modern literature. The purpose of this research, based on molecular data of the chloroplast ndhF gene, is to test the monophyly of Panicum, to evaluate infrageneric classifications, and to propose a robust phylogenetic hypothesis. Based on the present results, previous morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies, and inferred diagnostic morphological characters, we restrict Panicum sensu stricto (s.s.) to the former subgenus Panicum and support recognition of Dichanthelium, Phanopyrum, and Steinchisma as distinct genera. We have transfered other species of Panicum to other genera of the Paniceae. Most of the necessary combinations have been made previously, so few nomenclatural changes have been required. The remaining species of Panicum sensu lato (s.l.) are included within Panicum incertae sedis representing isolated species or species grouped within monophyletic clades. Additionally, we explore the performance of the three codon position characters in producing the supported phylogeny.},

	abstract = {The genus Limonium, due to the patchiness of the natural habitats of its species as well as the high frequency of hybridization and polyploidy and the possibility of reproduction by apomixis, provides an example of all the principal mechanisms of rapid speciation of plants. As an initial study of evolution in this genus, we have analyzed intra- and interspecific variability in 17 species from section Limonium, the largest in the genus, based on RFLPs of cpDNA and nuclear rDNA ITS sequences. In the cpDNA analysis, 21 restriction enzymes were used, resulting in 779 fragments, 490 of which were variable and 339 parsimony informative. L. furfuraceum exhibited two relatively divergent cpDNA haplotypes. The relationships found among the species based on cpDNA restriction fragments were coincident using different methods of phylogenetic analysis. Due to the presumed reticulate evolution in the genus Limonium, the comparison of these results with data from the nuclear DNA was necessary; ITS sequences were analyzed. The final alignment contained 488 characters, of which 198 were variable and 156 parsimony informative. Two relatively divergent ITS types were present at the intraindividual level in L. delicatulum, a triploid species. Each type was related to ITS from different groups of diploid Limonium species, one with a base haploid chromosome number n = 8 (represented by L. cossonianum) and the other with n = 9 (represented by L. minutum). The different phylogenetic inference methods used for the analysis of ITS sequences rendered very similar topologies. In general, the relationships among the species studied were coincident with those obtained with the chloroplast genome. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic markers support the polyphyly of section Limonium, with at least two species, L. narbonense and L. vulgare, clearly divergent from the rest. Moreover, the remaining subsections into which section Limonium is currently divided seem to be artificial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Platanaceae is an old family of angiosperms extending back to the Early Cretaceous but consisting of a single extant genus, Platanus. Species of Platanus have long been known to hybridize, and the London plane, Platanus x hispanica, is a well-known example of a hybrid species that formed in historical times. In addition, morphological studies have suggested past interspecific or interlineage hybridization and reticulation as possibly important factors in the evolution of the genus. This study aims at unravelling the complex evolutionary information contained in internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. METHODS The ITS of the 35S nuclear ribosomal DNA are biparentally inherited, multi-copy markers with a high potential for resolving intrageneric relationships especially when ancient hybridization (reticulation) is involved. Phylogenetic trees, splits graphs and motif analysis are used to extract phylogenetic information from 223 cloned ITS sequences, representing ten species and varieties of Platanus. Non-pseudogenous and pseudogenous sequence motives are assessed to explain how different evolutionary modes contribute to possibly conflicting character state patterns in the ITS. KEY RESULTS It was found that putative non-functional ITS copies ('pseudogenes') form distinct groups in phylograms and splits graphs, and that pseudogenous lineages reflect ancient hybridization events conserved in the ITS. Specifically, pseudogenous clones of an 'Atlantic' North American clade share sequence motives with non-pseudogenous clones of the western ('Pacific') North American P. racemosa species aggregate. In addition, evidence was found for recent lateral gene flow as a possible factor in the evolution of the central Mexican P. rzedowskii. CONCLUSIONS Broad ITS data sets that cover intra- and interindividual variability reveal past and ongoing speciation processes in Platanus. Evolutionary pathways can be visualized with splits graphs, but not with bifurcating trees.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Evolutionary radiations provide opportunities to examine large-scale patterns in diversification and character evolution, yet are often recalcitrant to phylogenetic resolution due to rapid speciation events. The plant genus Penstemon has been difficult to resolve using Sanger sequence-based markers, leading to the hypothesis that it represents a recent North American radiation. The current study demonstrates the utility of multiplexed shotgun genotyping (MSG), a style of restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), to infer phylogenetic relationships within a subset of species in this genus and provide insight into evolutionary patterns. METHODS We sampled genomic DNA, primarily from herbarium material, and subjected it to MSG library preparation and Illumina sequencing. The resultant sequencing reads were clustered into homologous loci, aligned, and concatenated into data matrices that differed according to clustering similarity and amount of missing data. We performed phylogenetic analyses on these matrices using maximum likelihood (RAxML) and a species tree approach (SVDquartets). KEY RESULTS MSG data provide a highly resolved estimate of species relationships within Penstemon. While most species relationships were highly supported, the position of certain taxa remains ambiguous, suggesting that increased taxonomic sampling or additional methodologies may be required. The data confirm that evolutionary shifts from hymenopteran- to hummingbird-adapted flowers have occurred independently many times. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that phylogenomic approaches yielding thousands of variable sites can greatly improve species-level resolution of recent and rapid radiations. Similar to other studies, we found that less conservative similarity and missing data thresholds resulted in more highly supported topologies.},

	abstract = {A reliable taxonomic framework and the identification of evolutionary lineages are essential for effective decisions in conservation biodiversity programs. However, phylogenetic reconstruction becomes extremely difficult when polyploidy and hybridization are involved. Veronica subsection Pentasepalae is a diploid-polyploid complex of ca. 20 species with ploidy levels ranging from 2x to 10x. Here, DNA-ploidy level estimations and AFLP fingerprinting were used to determine the evolutionary history, and species boundaries were reviewed in an integrated approach including also previous data (mainly morphology and sequence-based phylogenetic reconstructions). Molecular analyses were performed for 243 individuals from 95 populations, including for the first time all taxa currently recognized within the subsection. Phylogenetic reconstruction identified four main groups corresponding almost completely to the four clusters identified by genetic structure analyses. Multiple autopolyploidization events have occurred in the tetraploid V. satureiifolia giving rise to octoploid entities in central Europe and north of Spain, whereas hybridization is demonstrated to have occurred in several populations from the Balkan Peninsula. Furthermore, our study has established the taxonomic status of taxa, for the most part recovered as monophyletic. Cryptic taxa within the group have been identified, and a new species, Veronica dalmatica, is fully described. This study highlights the implications of polyploidy in species delimitation, and illustrates the importance to conserve polyploid populations as potential sources of diversification due to evolutionary significance of genome duplications in plant evolution.},

Mostly concentrated in the Mediterranean Basin, the tribe members are present both in the Old World and the New World. Current Antirrhineae phylogenies have different views on taxonomic relationships, and they lack homogeneity in terms of geographic distribution and ploidy levels. This study aims to investigate the changes in the chromosome numbers along with dispersal routes as definitive characters identifying clades. METHODS With the use of multiple DNA regions and taxon sampling enriched with de novo sequences, we provide an extensive phylogeny for Antirrhineae. The reconstructed phylogeny was then used to investigate changes in ploidy levels and dispersal patterns in the tribe using ChromEvol and RASP, respectively. KEY RESULTS Antirrhineae is a monophyletic group with six highly supported clades. ChromEvol analysis suggests the ancestral haploid chromosome number for the tribe is six, and that the tribe has experienced several duplications and gain events. The Mediterranean Basin was estimated to be the origin for the tribe with four long-distance dispersals from the Old World to the New World, three of which were associated with genome duplications. CONCLUSIONS On an updated Antirrhineae phylogeny, we showed that the three out of four dispersals from the Old World to the New World were coupled with changes in ploidy levels. The observed patterns suggest that increases in ploidy levels may facilitate dispersing into new environments.},

Looking for morphological synapomorphies for each monophyletic subgenus has been problematic, due to difficulties arising from widespread homoplasy (mainly parallel evolution). In an attempt to overcome these difficulties, previously underexplored morphological characters are starting to be studied in more depth. METHODS A molecular phylogenetic hypothesis was used based on sequences of ITS (nuclear ribosomal DNA) and plastid trnL-F regions, as a framework to test the use of seed coat ultrastructure (studied under scanning electron microscope) in the systematics of the genus. A sample of 132 taxa representing ten of the 13 subgenera in Veronica, excluding the species of the southern hemisphere Hebe complex and the exclusively North American subgenus Synthyris, was studied. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate that, in many cases, the ultrastucture of the testa can be employed to assess relationships of taxa within the genus, and the character provides additional support for molecular trees. Further characters relevant for the classification of Veronica, i.e. base chromosome number, iridoid chemical data, life cycle, inflorescence position, have been taken into consideration in a discussion where an attempt is made to highlight the best traits to characterize each subgenus investigated.},

We evaluate the generation-time hypothesis using 131 DNA sequences from the plastid trnLF region and the nuclear ribosomal ITS region of the genus Veronica (Plantaginaceae). We also examine the alternative hypothesis that a higher substitution rate is correlated with selfing breeding system. Selfing is associated with annual life history in many organisms and may thus often be the underlying reason for observed correlations of annual life history with other characters. We provide evidence that annual life history is more likely to be the responsible factor for higher substitution rates in Veronica than a selfing breeding system. Nevertheless, the way in which annual life history may influence substitution rate in detail remains unknown, and some possibilities are discussed.},

Analyses of AFLP data recovered five major lineages within Chionohebe, some of which corresponded to species and varieties as currently circumscribed. Although the cushion chionohebes were strongly supported as monophyletic, the sole non-cushion species, C. densifolia, was sister to Parahebe trifida, and thus the AFLP data do not support a monophyletic Chionohebe as usually circumscribed. Strong north/south and west/east phylogeographic patterns were found among and within the main AFLP lineages in New Zealand. Analyses of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) revealed eight haplotypes in Chionohebe, but these did not correspond to current taxonomy or geography due to widespread interspecific haplotype sharing. Based on both AFLP and cpDNA results, the two trans-Tasman species are shown to have originated in New Zealand and dispersed to Australia independently.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED • PREMISE OF THE STUDY Over the past 75 Myr, successive groups of plants have entered the "oil bee pollination niche," meaning that they depend on oil-collecting bees for their pollination. The highly dissimilar numbers of plant species and bee species involved in these mutualisms imply evolutionary host switching, asymmetric mutual dependencies, and uncoupled diversification. Among the clades with the best field data on oil bee behavior is the Angelonieae, which we here investigate to better understand the evolutionary time frame of this pollination syndrome.• METHODS We generated nuclear and plastid data matrices for 56\% of the Angelonieae species (plus outgroups) and used Bayesian methods of molecular clock dating, ancestral state reconstruction, and biogeographic inference.• KEY RESULTS We found that Angelonieae have two major clades, Angelonia (including Monopera) and Basistemon, and Monttea, Melosperma, and Ourisia.• CONCLUSIONS Angelonieae date back to the Uppermost Eocene, ca. 35 (26-47) Myr ago (Ma) and diversified in dry areas of southern South America; they switched from nectar to oil as a reward four or five times over the past 25 Ma. As predicted in a previous non-clock-dated study, dispersal to Australasia dates to the Miocene/Pliocene.},

Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the taxonomically complex subgenus Plantago were conducted to elucidate intrasubgeneric phylogenetic relationships. A nuclear-encoding single-copy gene, SUC1 (1.0-1.8 kb), was sequenced in 24 taxa representing all five sections of the subgenus Plantago and two taxa from subgenus Coronopus as the outgroup. Fifteen known polyploids and one putative polyploid were sampled to examine polyploid origins and occurrence of reticulate evolution by cloning and sequence analysis of SUC1. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated using maximum parsimony, neighbor-joining, and Bayesian analyses. For the first time, our analysis provides a highly resolved phylogenetic tree. Subgenus Plantago formed a well-supported monophyletic clade. In contrast, alleles from polyploid species were scattered across the whole SUC1 phylogenetic tree, and some independent allopolyploids originated from hybridization between distant lineages. One reason for this taxonomic complexity can be attributed to reticulate evolution within the subgenus Plantago. Our results also suggest the possibility of two independent long-distance dispersals between the northern and southern hemispheres.},

The Hawaiian Plantago radiation comprises six endemic taxa showing considerable inter- and intraspecific morphological and ecological diversity. The rDNA internal (ITS) and external (ETS) transcribed spacers and two recently described chloroplast spacers, ndhF-rpl32 and rpl32-trnL, were sequenced to study phylogenetic relationships within this morphologically complex group. Phylogenetic analysis provided strong evidence for the monophyly of Hawaiian Plantago, suggesting that the lineage arose from a single long-distance dispersal event. Inconsistencies between nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies suggest a history of hybridization. The basal, unresolved dichotomy of the combined phylogeny is consistent with rapid phenotypic diversification of the major lineages early in the history of this group. Speciation has largely occurred allopatrically, with divergence a result of intraisland ecological shifts between bog and woodland habitats and interisland dispersal events. Most interisland colonizations were from older to younger islands with initial colonization of Kaua'i. In our analysis, P. pachyphylla is paraphyletic and taxonomic separation of the distinct morphotypes of this species appears justified. Furthermore, the apparent hybrid ancestry and unique morphology and habitat of the endangered P. princeps var. longibracteata support its recognition at the specific rank.},

To resolve the backbone relationships of Veronica, we added sequences from additional plastid DNA regions to existing data and analyzed matching data sets for 78 taxa and more than 5000 aligned characters from nuclear ribosomal DNA and plastid DNA regions. The results provide the best resolved and supported estimate of relationships among major groups in the Northern (Veronica s. str.) and Southern Hemisphere (hebes).

We performed both maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses, which produced congruent results. Sequence divergence was 0.0\% between Hawaiian members of Pittosporum. These taxa formed a strongly supported clade, suggesting a single colonization event followed by phyletic radiation. Sister to the Hawaiian clade were two South Pacific species, P. yunckeri from Tonga and P. rhytidocarpum from Fiji. This result presents convincing evidence for a South Pacific origin of Hawaiian Pittosporum. Our results also identify a monophyletic group comprising three species representing the Fijian Province and East Polynesia, two introductions onto New Caledonia, and at least one (but possibly two) introduction(s) onto New Zealand. Whether the New Zealand taxa form a monophyletic group is unclear from these data. Previous morphologically based hypotheses, however, suggest the presence of four different lineages occupying New Zealand. The nonmonophyly of the New Caledonian species was not surprising based on the extent of their morphological diversity. Although this latter result is not strongly supported, these species are morphologically complex and are currently the subject of taxonomic revision and molecular systematic analyses.},

The order includes three species rich genera, Piper (ca. 2000 species), Peperomia (ca. 1500-1700 species), and Aristolochia s. l. (ca. 500 species). Sequences of the matK gene and the non-coding trnK group II intron are analysed for a dense set of 105 taxa representing all families (except Hydnoraceae) and all generic segregates (except Euglypha within Aristolochiaceae) of Piperales. A large number of highly informative indels are found in the Piperales trnK/matK dataset. Within a narrow region approximately 500 nt downstream in the matK coding region (CDS), a length variable simple sequence repeat (SSR) expansion segment occurs, in which insertions and deletions have led to short frame-shifts. These are corrected shortly afterwards, resulting in a maximum of six amino acids being affected. Furthermore, additional non-functional matK copies were found in Zippelia begoniifolia, which can easily be discriminated from the functional open reading frame (ORF). The trnK/matK sequence data fully resolve relationships within Peperomia, whereas they are not effective within Piper. The resolution contrast is correlated with the rate heterogeneity between those lineages. Parsimony, Bayesian and likelihood analyses result in virtually the same topology, and converge on the monophyly of Piperaceae and Saururaceae. Lactoris gains high support as sister to Aristolochiaceae subf. Aristolochioideae, but the different tree inference methods yield conflicting results with respect to the relationships of subfam. Asaroideae. In Piperaceae, a clade formed by the monotypic genus Zippelia and the small genus Manekia (=Sarcorhachis) is sister to the two large genera Piper and Peperomia.},

Here, we provide evidence for relaxation of selection on the putative petal and stamen identity genes, homologs of APETALA3 and PISTILLATA, following the loss of petals in the Piperales. Our results are particularly interesting as the B-class genes are not only responsible for the production of petals but are also central to stamen identity, the male reproductive organs that show no modification in these plants. Relaxed purifying selection after the loss of only one of these organs suggests that there has been dissociation of the functional roles of these genes in the Piperales.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The perianthless Piperales, i.e. Saururaceae and Piperaceae, have simple reduced flowers strikingly different from the other families of the order (e.g. Aristolochiaceae). Recent molecular phylogenies proved Verhuellia to be the first branch in Piperaceae, making it a promising subject to study the detailed structure and development of the flowers. Based on recently collected material, the first detailed study since 1872 was conducted with respect to morphology, anatomy and development of the inflorescence, pollen ultrastructure and fruit anatomy. METHODS Original scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and light microscopy (LM) observations on Verhuellia lunaria were compared with those of Piperaceae, Saururaceae and fossils. KEY RESULTS The inflorescence is an indeterminate spike with sessile flowers, each in the axil of a bract, developing in acropetal, helical succession. Flowers consist of two (occasionally three) stamens with basifixed tetrasporangiate anthers and latrorse dehiscence by a longitudinal slit. The gynoecium lacks a style but has 3-4 stigma branches and a single, basal orthotropous and unitegmic ovule. The fruit is a drupe with large multicellular epidermal protuberances. The pollen is very small, inaperturate and areolate, with hemispherical microechinate exine elements. CONCLUSIONS Despite the superficial similarities with different genera of Piperaceae and Saururaceae, the segregate position of Verhuellia revealed by molecular phylogenetics is supported by morphological, developmental and anatomical data presented here. Unitegmic ovules and inaperturate pollen, which are synapomorphies for the genus Peperomia, are also present in Verhuellia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The rapidly increasing number of available plant genomes opens up almost unlimited prospects for biology in general and molecular phylogenetics in particular. A recent study took advantage of this data and identified a set of nuclear genes that occur in single copy in multiple sequenced angiosperms. The present study is the first to apply genomic sequence of one of these low copy genes, agt1, as a phylogenetic marker for species-level phylogenetics. Its utility is compared to the performance of several coding and non-coding chloroplast loci that have been suggested as most applicable for this taxonomic level. As a model group, we chose Tildenia, a subgenus of Peperomia (Piperaceae), one of the largest plant genera. Relationships are particularly difficult to resolve within these species rich groups due to low levels of polymorphisms and fast or recent radiation. Therefore, Tildenia is a perfect test case for applying new phylogenetic tools. RESULTS We show that the nuclear marker agt1, and in particular the agt1 introns, provide a significantly increased phylogenetic signal compared to chloroplast markers commonly used for low level phylogenetics. 25\% of aligned characters from agt1 intron sequence are parsimony informative. In comparison, the introns and spacer of several common chloroplast markers (trnK intron, trnK-psbA spacer, ndhF-rpl32 spacer, rpl32-trnL spacer, psbA-trnH spacer) provide less than 10\% parsimony informative characters. The agt1 dataset provides a deeper resolution than the chloroplast markers in Tildenia. CONCLUSIONS Single (or very low) copy nuclear genes are of immense value in plant phylogenetics. Compared to other nuclear genes that are members of gene families of all sizes, lab effort, such as cloning, can be kept to a minimum. They also provide regions with different phylogenetic content deriving from coding and non-coding parts of different length. Thus, they can be applied to a wide range of taxonomic levels from family down to population level. As more plant genomes are sequenced, we will obtain increasingly precise information about which genes return to single copy most rapidly following gene duplication and may be most useful across a wide range of plant groups.},

	abstract = {Abies, the second largest genus of Pinaceae, consists of approximately 48 species occurring in the north temperate region. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies improved our understanding of relationships within the genus, but were limited by relying on only DNA sequence data from single genome and low taxonomic sampling. Here we use DNA data from three genomes (sequences of internal transcribed spacer of nrITS, three chloroplast DNA intergenic spacers, and two mitochondrial intergenic spacers) from 42 species to elucidate species relationships and construct the biogeographic history of Abies. We further estimated the divergence times of intercontinental disjunction using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated with three macro-fossils. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered six robust clades largely consistent with previous classifications of sections. A sister relationship between the eastern Asian and Europe-Mediterranean clades was highly supported. The monophyly of section Balsamea, disjunct in Far East and western North America, is supported by the nrITS data but not by the cpDNA data. Discordance on placement of section Balsamea between the paternally inherited cpDNA and maternally inherited mtDNA trees was also observed. The data suggested that ancient hybridization was likely involved in the origin of sect. Balsamea. Results from biogeographic analyses and divergence time estimation suggested an origin and early diversification of Abies in an area of high latitude around the Pacific during the Eocene. The present disjunction in eastern Asia and Europe-Mediterranean area of Abies was likely the result of southward migration and isolation by the Turgai Strait in the Late Eocene. An 'out-of-America' migration, for the origin of an eastern Asian and western North American disjunct species pairs in section Amabilis was supported. The results suggested a western North American origin of the section with subsequent dispersal across the Bering Land Bridge (BLB) to Japan during the Middle Miocene.},

	abstract = {Climatic oscillations and geological events play major roles in shaping species diversity and the distribution of plants. The mechanisms underlying the high level of plant species diversity in eastern Asia are hotly debated. In this study, five cpDNA regions, two mtDNA fragments and one nuclear gene (LEAFY) were employed to investigate species diversification and the historical biogeography of Pseudotsuga (Pinaceae), a genus with a typical eastern Asia and western North America disjunct distribution. Both the nuclear LEAFY gene and cpDNA phylogenies strongly suggest that eastern Asian and North American species are monophyletic, respectively. Within the eastern Asia clade, the cpDNA tree placed P. japonica as sister to the rest of the Asian species, but the LEAFY gene tree showed a sister relationship between P. japonica-P. sinensis-P. gaussenii and P. brevifolia-P. forrestii. Molecular dating indicated that the Asian species last shared a common ancestor 20.26+/-5.84 mya and the species diversification of Pseudotsuga was correlated with the Tertiary climatic and tectonic changes. These results, together with the fossil evidence, suggest that Pseudotsuga might have originated from North America and then migrated to eastern Asia by the Bering land bridge during the early Miocene. The Taiwanese species P. wilsoniana harbored two divergent types of LEAFY sequences, which implies that this species might have originated by hybridization between P. brevifolia or its ancestor and the ancestor of P. japonica-P. sinensis-P. gaussenii. Our study also suggests that Taiwan is closely related to both southwest and east China in flora.},

All 4CL clones of Larix formed a strongly supported monophyletic group, in which two robust clades (4clA and 4clB) derived from an ancient gene duplication event in the common ancestor of Larix were identified. Further gene duplication in the 4clA clade gave rise to two subclades 4clA(1) and 4clA(2). Frequent duplication/deletion appears to be a common evolutionary phenomenon in the 4CL gene family and paralogous genes differ greatly in their evolution rate. The existence of L. speciosa in subclades 4clA(1) and 4clA(2) suggests that this species may represent a primitive form of Larix or the closest relative of the common ancestor of the Eurasian Sect. Multiserialis. In addition, cpDNA and nrDNA ITS analyses support the hypothesis of an early separation of Larix into a North American and a Eurasian clade, which is congruent with the results of previous allozyme and very recent AFLP analyses. The unexpected close relationship between North American larches and the short-bracted species L. gmelinii in East Asia, based on the 4CL gene tree, may stem from lineage sorting.},

Systematic investigations into the modes of inheritance, rates and patterns of recombination, nucleotide substitution, and structural changes in the mt genome are still lacking in many groups of plants. In this study, we sequenced {\textgreater}11kbp mtDNA segments from multiple accessions of 36 pine species to characterize the evolutionary patterns of mtDNA in the genus Pinus. We found extremely low substitution rates and complex repetitive sequences scattered across different genome regions, as well as chimeric structures that were probably generated by multiple intergenomic recombinations. The mtDNA-based phylogeny of the genus differed from that based on chloroplast and nuclear DNA in the placement of several groups of species. Such discordances suggest a series of mtDNA capture events during past range shifts of the pine species and that both vertical and horizontal inheritance are implicated in the evolution of mtDNA in Pinus. MtDNA dating revealed that most extant lineages of the genus originated during Oligocene-Miocene radiation and subgenus Strobus diversified earlier than subgenus Pinus. Our findings illustrate a reticular evolutionary pathway for the mt genome through capture and recombination in the genus Pinus, and provide new insights into the evolution of the genus.},

	abstract = {The center of diversity is not necessarily the place of origin, as has been established by many plant molecular phylogenies. Picea is a complicated but very important genus in coniferous forests of the Northern Hemisphere, with a high species diversity in Asia. Its phylogeny and biogeography were investigated here using sequence analysis of the paternally inherited chloroplast trnC-trnD and trnT-trnF regions and the maternally inherited mitochondrial nad5 intron 1. We found that the North American P. breweriana and P. sitchensis were basal to the other spruces that were further divided into three clades in the cpDNA phylogeny, and that the New World species harbored four of five mitotypes detected, including two ancestral ones and three endemics. These results, combined with biogeographic analyses using DIVA and MacClade and fossil evidence, suggest that Picea originated in North America, and that its present distribution could stem from two times of dispersal from North America to Asia by the Beringian land bridge, and then from Asia to Europe. Most of the northeastern Asian species and the European P. abies could arise from a recent radiation given the very low interspecific genetic differentiation and pure mitotype of them. Considering that the ancestral mtDNA polymorphism can be preserved in many descendant species, even distantly related ones, we suggest that more species, at least the closely related ones, should be sampled in the phylogeographical study using cytoplasmic haplotypes if possible. In addition, we also discussed the evolution and phylogenetic utility of morphological characters in Picea.},

Its evolution and biogeography are of great interest to botanists. This study aims to investigate the phylogeny and biogeography of Cedrus based on sequence analyses of seven cytoplasmic DNA fragments. METHODS The methods used were PCR amplification and sequencing of seven paternal cpDNA and maternal mtDNA fragments, parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of the DNA dataset, and molecular clock estimate of divergence times of Cedrus species. KEY RESULTS Phylogenies of Cedrus constructed from cpDNA, mtDNA and the combined cp- and mt-DNA dataset are identical in topology. It was found that the Himalayan cedar C. deodara diverged first, and then the North African species C. atlantica separated from the common ancestor of C. libani and C. brevifolia, two species from the eastern Mediterranean area. Molecular clock estimates suggest that the divergence between C. atlantica and the eastern Mediterranean clade at 23.49 +/- 3.55 to 18.81 +/- 1.25 Myr and the split between C. libani and C. brevifolia at 7.83 +/- 2.79 to 6.56 +/- 1.20 Myr. CONCLUSIONS The results, combined with palaeogeographical and palaeoecological information, indicate that Cedrus could have an origin in the high latitude area of Eurasia, and its present distribution might result from vicariance of southerly migrated populations during climatic oscillations in the Tertiary and further fragmentation and dispersal of these populations. It is very likely that Cedrus migrated into North Africa in the very late Tertiary, while its arrival in the Himalayas would not have been before the Miocene, after which the phased or fast uplift of the Tibetan plateau happened.},

Simultaneously, the risk of incorporating 'noisy' data with misleading phylogenetic signal has also increased, and may disproportionately influence the topology of weakly supported nodes and lineages featuring rapid radiations and/or elevated rates of evolution. RESULTS We investigated the influence of phylogenetic noise in large data sets by applying two fundamental strategies, variable site removal and long-branch exclusion, to the phylogenetic analysis of a full plastome alignment of 107 species of Pinus and six Pinaceae outgroups. While high overall phylogenetic resolution resulted from inclusion of all data, three historically recalcitrant nodes remained conflicted with previous analyses. Close investigation of these nodes revealed dramatically different responses to data removal. Whereas topological resolution and bootstrap support for two clades peaked with removal of highly variable sites, the third clade resolved most strongly when all sites were included. Similar trends were observed using long-branch exclusion, but patterns were neither as strong nor as clear. When compared to previous phylogenetic analyses of nuclear loci and morphological data, the most highly supported topologies seen in Pinus plastome analysis are congruent for the two clades gaining support from variable site removal and long-branch exclusion, but in conflict for the clade with highest support from the full data set. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that removal of misleading signal in phylogenomic datasets can result not only in increased resolution for poorly supported nodes, but may serve as a tool for identifying erroneous yet highly supported topologies. For Pinus chloroplast genomes, removal of variable sites appears to be more effective than long-branch exclusion for clarifying phylogenetic hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Studies over the past ten years have shown that the crown groups of most conifer genera are only about 15-25 Ma old. The genus Picea (spruces, Pinaceae), with around 35 species, appears to be no exception. In addition, molecular studies of co-existing spruce species have demonstrated frequent introgression. Perhaps not surprisingly therefore previous phylogenetic studies of species relationships in Picea, based mostly on plastid sequences, suffered from poor statistical support. We therefore generated mitochondrial, nuclear, and further plastid DNA sequences from carefully sourced material, striking a balance between alignability with outgroups and phylogenetic signal content. Motif duplications in mitochondrial introns were treated as characters in a stochastic Dollo model; molecular clock models were calibrated with fossils; and ancestral ranges were inferred under maximum likelihood. In agreement with previous findings, Picea diverged from its sister clade 180 million years ago (Ma), and the most recent common ancestor of today's spruces dates to 28 Ma. Different from previous analyses though, we find a large Asian clade, an American clade, and a Eurasian clade. Two expansions occurred from Asia to North America and several between Asia and Europe. Chinese P. brachytyla, American P. engelmannii, and Norway spruce, P. abies, are not monophyletic, and North America has ten, not eight species. Divergence times imply that Pleistocene refugia are unlikely to be the full explanation for the relationships between the European species and their East Asian relatives. Thus, northern Norway spruce may be part of an Asian species complex that diverged from the southern Norway spruce lineage in the Upper Miocene, some 6 Ma, which can explain the deep genetic gap noted in phylogeographic studies of Norway spruce. The large effective population sizes of spruces, and incomplete lineage sorting during speciation, mean that the interspecific relationships within each of the geographic clades require further studies, especially based on genomic information and population genetic data.},

	abstract = {Nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) has been considered as an important tool for inferring phylogenetic relationships at many taxonomic levels. In comparison with its fast concerted evolution in angiosperms, nrDNA is symbolized by slow concerted evolution and substantial ITS region length variation in gymnosperms, particularly in Pinaceae. Here we studied structure characteristics, including subrepeat composition, size, GC content and secondary structure, of nrDNA ITS regions of all Pinaceae genera. The results showed that the ITS regions of all taxa studied contained subrepeat units, ranging from 2 to 9 in number, and these units could be divided into two types, longer subrepeat (LSR) without the motif (5'-GGCCACCCTAGTC) and shorter subrepeat (SSR) with the motif. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the homology of some SSRs still can be recognized, providing important informations for the evolutionary history of nrDNA ITS and phylogeny of Pinaceae. In particular, the adjacent tandem SSRs are not more closely related to one another than they are to remote SSRs in some genera, which may imply that multiple structure variations such as recombination have occurred in the ITS1 region of these groups. This study also found that GC content in the ITS1 region is relevant to its sequence length and subrepeat number, and could provide some phylogenetic information, especially supporting the close relationships among Picea, Pinus, and Cathaya. Moreover, several characteristics of the secondary structure of Pinaceae ITS1 were found as follows: (1) the structure is dominated by several extended hairpins; (2) the configuration complexity is positively correlated with subrepeat number; (3) paired subrepeats often partially overlap at the conserved motif (5'-GGCCACCCTAGTC), and form a long stem, while other subrepeats fold onto itself, leaving part of the conserved motif exposed in hairpin loops.},

Such consequences should be most evident in plant groups that are ancient, widespread, and diverse. As one of the most widespread genera of trees, Pinus provides a good model for investigating the history of species diversification and biogeographic disjunction in the Northern Hemisphere. In this study, we reconstructed the phylogeny and investigated the evolutionary and biogeographic history of sect. Quinquefoliae (Pinus), a species-rich lineage disjunctly distributed in Asia, Europe and North America, based on complete taxon sampling and by using nine DNA fragments from chloroplast (cp), mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear genomes. The monophyly of the three subsections, Krempfianae, Gerardianae, and Strobus, is well-supported by cpDNA and nuclear gene phylogenies. However, neither subsect. Gerardianae nor subsect. Strobus forms a monophyletic group in the mtDNA phylogeny, in which sect. Quinquefoliae was divided into two major clades, one consisting of the North American and northeastern Asian species as well as the European P. peuce of subsect. Strobus, and the other comprising the remaining Eurasian species belonging to three subsections. The significant topological incongruence among the gene trees, in conjunction with divergence time estimation and ancestral area reconstruction, indicates that both ancient and relatively recent introgressive hybridization events occurred in the evolution of sect. Quinquefoliae, particularly in northeastern Asia and northwestern North America. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis suggests that the species of subsect. Strobus from subtropical eastern Asia and neighboring areas may have a single origin, although species non-monophyly is very widespread in the nuclear gene trees. Moreover, our study seems to support a Tethyan origin of sect. Quinquefoliae given the distributions and phylogenetic positions of subsects. Krempfianae and Gerardianae, and also highlights the importance of active mountain buildings and climatic changes during the Late Neogene in shaping the species diversity and geographic distribution of Pinus.},

Whereas absence of the intron in seven angiosperms and Welwitschia is likely due to seven independent losses when evaluated against the recently published multigene phylogenies, the lack of the intron in all non-Pinaceae conifers can be best explained by a single loss. These data suggest that the non-Pinaceae conifers represent a monophyletic group.

Although they have evolved under similar environmental conditions, they diversified long ago, ca. 10 Mya, and present distinct biogeographic and demographic histories. Therefore, it is of special interest to understand whether and to what extent they have developed specific strategies of adaptive evolution through time and space. To explore evolutionary patterns, the Mediterranean pines' phylogeny was first reconstructed analyzing a new set of 21 low-copy nuclear genes with multilocus Bayesian tree reconstruction methods. Secondly, a phylogenetic approach was used to search for footprints of natural selection and to examine the evolution of multiple phenotypic traits. We identified two genes (involved in pines' defense and stress responses) that have likely played a role in the adaptation of Mediterranean pines to their environment. Moreover, few life-history traits showed historical or evolutionary adaptive convergence in Mediterranean lineages, while patterns of character evolution revealed various evolutionary trade-offs linking growth-development, reproduction and fire-related traits. Assessing the evolutionary path of important life-history traits, as well as the genomic basis of adaptive variation is central to understanding the past evolutionary success of Mediterranean pines and their future response to environmental changes.},

Cembroides and nine representatives from four other subsections of subgenus Strobus. Restriction digests of clones reveal within-individual heterogeneity, suggesting that concerted evolution is operating slowly on the ITS in pine species. Two ITS clones were identified as pseudogenes. Tandem subrepeats in the ITS1 form stem loops comparable to those in other genera of Pinaceae and may be promoting recombination between rDNA repeats, resulting in ITS1 chimeras. Within the pinyon clade, phylogenetic structure is present, but different clones from the same (or different) individuals of a species are polyphyletic, indicating that coalescence of ITS copies within individual genomes predates evolutionary divergence in the group. At the level of subsection and above, the ITS region corresponds well with morphological and cpDNA evidence. Except for P. nelsonii, the pinyons are monophyletic, with both subsect.

	abstract = {Elucidating phylogenetic relationships and species boundaries within complex taxonomic groups is challenging for intrinsic and extrinsic (i.e., technical) reasons. Mexican pinyon pines are a complex group whose phylogenetic relationships and species boundaries have been widely studied but poorly resolved, partly due to intrinsic ecological and evolutionary features such as low morphological and genetic differentiation caused by recent divergence, hybridization and introgression. Extrinsic factors such as limited sampling and difficulty in selecting informative molecular markers have also impeded progress. Some of the Mexican pinyon pines are of conservation concern but others may remain unprotected because the species boundaries have not been established. In this study we combined approaches to resolve the phylogenetic relationships in this complex group and to establish species boundaries in four recently diverged taxa: P. discolor, P. johannis, P. culminicola and P. cembroides. We performed phylogenetic analyses using the chloroplast markers matK and psbA-trnH as well as complete and partial chloroplast genomes of species of Subsection Cembroides. Additionally, we performed a phylogeographic analysis combining genetic data (18 chloroplast markers), morphological data and geographical data to define species boundaries in four recently diverged taxa. Ecological divergence was supported by differences in climate among localities for distinct genetic lineages. Whereas the phylogenetic analysis inferred with matK and psbA-trnH was unable to resolve the relationships in this complex group, we obtained a resolved phylogeny with the use of the chloroplast genomes. The resolved phylogeny was concordant with a haplotype network obtained using chloroplast markers. In species with potential for recent divergence, hybridization or introgression, nonhierarchical network-based approaches are probably more appropriate to protect against misclassification due to incomplete lineage sorting. The boundaries among genetic lineages were delimited by the inclusion of morphological, geographical and ecological data in the haplotype network. These multiple lines of evidence help to assign species boundaries in this complex group. P. johannis, P. discolor, P. culminicola and P. cembroides are different species based on their genetic, morphological and ecological niche differences. We suggest a reevaluation of the conservation status of these species considering the information generated in this study.},

Here, we present phylogenetic tests of this hypothesis using chloroplast sequence data from four loci for 83 pine species. We used the fossil-based hypothesis to derive null expectations concerning monophyly of taxonomic groups, dates of cladogenesis, and patterns of diversification. Phylogenetic analyses using several algorithms subsequently provided rigorous tests of these expectations. Our inferred phylogenies illustrated broad congruence with taxonomic groups, but highlighted consistent problems within subgenus Strobus. Estimated minimum dates of divergence derived from relaxed clock methods were largely consistent with the fossil record and yielded a date for the ingroup node of Pinus of 128+/-4 mya, depending upon the calibration used for subgenus Pinus. Ancestral area reconstructions showed Pinus to have most likely originated in Eurasia. Major clades differed in biogeographic patterns, but were consistent with the fossil-based hypothesis. We found weak support, however, for a change in diversification rate in the Eocene as interpretations of fossil distributions would have predicted.},

Two subrepeats are tandem, remote from the third, and more closely related and significantly more similar to one another than either is to the third subrepeat. This correlation between similarity and proximity may be the result of subrepeat duplication or concerted evolution within rDNA repeats.

	abstract = {The genus Abies is distributed discontinuously in the temperate and subtropical montane forests of the northern hemisphere. In Mesoamerica (Mexico and northern Central America), modern firs originated from the divergence of isolated mountain populations of migrating North American taxa. However, the number of ancestral species, migratory waves and diversification speed of these taxa is unknown. Here, variation in repetitive (Pt30204, Pt63718, and Pt71936) and non-repetitive (rbcL, rps18-rpl20 and trnL-trnF) regions of the chloroplast genome was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the Mesoamerican Abies in a genus-wide context. These phylogenies and two fossil-calibrated scenarios were further employed to estimate divergence dates and diversification rates within the genus, and to test the hypothesis that, as in many angiosperms, conifers may exhibit accelerated speciation rates in the subtropics. All phylogenies showed five main clusters that mostly agreed with the currently recognized sections of Abies and with the geographic distribution of species. The Mesoamerican taxa formed a single group with species from southwestern North America of sections Oiamel and Grandis. However, populations of the same species were not monophyletic within this group. Divergence of this whole group dated back to the late Paleocene and the early Miocene depending on the calibration used, which translated in very low diversification rates (r(0.0)=0.026-0.054, r(0.9)=0.009-0.019 sp/Ma). Such low rates were a constant along the entire genus, including both the subtropical and temperate taxa. An extended phylogeographic analysis on the Mesoamerican clade indicated that Abies flinckii and A. concolor were the most divergent taxa, while the remaining species (A. durangensis, A. guatemalensis, A. hickelii, A. religiosa and A. vejari) formed a single group. Altogether, these results show that divergence of Mesoamerican firs coincides with a model of environmental stasis and decreased extinction rate, being probably prompted by a series of range expansions and isolation-by-distance.},

A molecular phylogenetic analysis of the newly circumscribed and expanded tribe Poranthereae (Phyllanthaceae) is presented. Sampling included 97 accessions for 63 of c. 120 species. Largely congruent results have been obtained from nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid matK sequences. These analyses support the recognition of Andrachne and Leptopus as distinct genera. The deceptively similar Andrachne section Phyllanthopsis, Andrachne ovalis, and Leptopus decaisnei are separate lineages to be segregated. Zimmermannia and Zimmermanniopsis are embedded in Meineckia; Oreoporanthera is embedded in Poranthera; and Archileptopus is embedded in Leptopus. Andrachne section Pseudophyllanthus is polyphyletic, the two Madagascan endemics emerging as a sister clade to Meineckia. The noncontiguous distributions of Andrachne sensu lato and Leptopus sensu lato were found to be the result of separate evolutionary histories of morphologically similar clades, whereas Andrachne sensu stricto and Meineckia remain geographically disjunct. Actephila and Leptopus are sisters with a sympatric distribution in humid Asia. Presence of petals appears to be plesiomorphic for the tribe. Petals are reduced in Actephila and Oreoporanthera and lost in the Meineckia clade.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS A recent molecular phylogenetic study showed that Sauropus is deeply embedded within Phyllanthus together with its allies, Breynia and Glochidion. As relationships within Sauropus are still problematic and the relationship with Breynia has long been doubted, more molecular data are needed to test/corroborate such a broad definition of Phyllanthus. This study aims to clarify the status and delimitation of Sauropus and establish its position within Phyllanthaceae. METHODS Plastid matK and nuclear ribosomal ITS DNA sequence data for Sauropus and its allies were used to construct phylogenetic trees using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods. KEY RESULTS Within Phyllanthus, Sauropus can be split into the mainly south-east Asian Sauropus sensu stricto (s.s.) plus Breynia and the mainly Australian Sauropus (formerly Synostemon). Sauropus s.s. plus Breynia comprise two distinct clades; one is the combination of Sauropus sections Glochidioidei, Sauropus and Schizanthi and the other is the combination of Sauropus sections Cryptogynium and Hemisauropus and the monophyletic genus Breynia. CONCLUSIONS Molecular data indicate that Synostemon should be reinstated at the same level as Sauropus s.s. and that Sauropus s.s. should be united with Breynia under the latter, older name. The molecular data corroborate only two of the five infrageneric groups of Sauropus recognized on the basis of morphological data.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships within tribe Phyllantheae, the largest tribe of the family Phyllanthaceae, were examined with special emphasis on the large genus Phyllanthus. Nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid matK DNA sequence data for 95 species of tribe Phyllantheae, including representatives of all subgenera of Phyllanthus (except Cyclanthera) and several hitherto unplaced infrageneric groups, were analyzed. Results for ITS and matK are generally concordant, although some species are placed differently in the plastid and ITS trees, indicating that hybridization/paralogy is involved. Results confirm paraphyly of Phyllanthus in its traditional circumscription with embedded Breynia, Glochidion, Reverchonia, and Sauropus. We favor the inclusion of the embedded taxa in Phyllanthus over further generic segregation. Monophyletic Phyllanthus comprises an estimated 1269 species, making it one of the "giant" genera. Phyllanthus maderaspatensis is sister to all other species of Phyllanthus, and the genus appears to be of paleotropical origin. Subgenera Isocladus, Kirganelia, and Phyllanthus are polyphyletic, whereas other subgenera appear to be monophyletic. Monotypic Reverchonia is sister to P. abnormis, arborescent section Emblica to herbaceous Urinaria, free-floating aquatic P. fluitans to the weed P. caroliniensis, and the phyllocladous section Choretropsis to the delicate leafy P. claussenii. The unique branching architecture known as "phyllanthoid branching" found in most Phyllanthus taxa has been lost (and/or has been derived) repeatedly. Taxonomic divisions within Phyllantheae based on similar pollen morphology are confirmed, and related taxa share similar distributions. We recommend recognition of six clades at generic level: Flueggea s.l. (including Richeriella), Lingelsheimia, Margaritaria, Phyllanthus s.l. (including Breynia, Glochidion, Reverchonia, and Sauropus), P. diandrus, and Savia section Heterosavia.},

Our analyses include sampling from 54 of 59 genera, representing all tribes and subtribes of Phyllanthoideae. The family falls into two major clades characterized by inflorescence and leaf anatomical features. Several traditional taxonomic groupings were retrieved with minor modifications, but most clades recovered are considerably different from previous non-molecular based ideas of relationships. The enigmatic genus Dicoelia and the geographically disjunct genus Lingelsheimia are shown to be embedded in Phyllanthaceae. The taxonomic status of Leptopus diplospermus (=Chorisandrachne) and the debated placement of Andrachne ovalis have been clarified, and Protomegabaria and Richeriella are newly placed.

This is the first study addressing intrafamilial relationships of Penaeaceae and Oliniaceae based on molecular data. All analyses conducted on the six separate and combined data sets produce similar tree topologies without any major conflicts. The resulting phylogenies suggest that the monospecific New World Alzateaceae is sister to the three African taxa and that the monospecific Rhynchocalycaceae is sister to Oliniaceae/Penaeaceae. Within Penaeaceae, our results partially contradict traditional generic circumscriptions, suggesting, for example, that Brachysiphon and Stylapterus are paraphyletic. Within the monogeneric Oliniaceae the analyses reveal two well-supported clades. We also performed comparative studies of floral development and morphology of Penaeaceae, Oliniaceae, and Rhynchocalycaceae. We analyze the results of these comparativel studies in the context of the molecular phylogeny to test competing hypotheses of perianth organ homology in Penaeaceae and Oliniaceae. Our analyses show that flowers of both families are most parsimoniously interpreted as having an obhaplostemonous organization. The respective homology of calyx and corolla among the three families is further supported by congruent patterns of floral development and structural similarities including anatomical and histological features.},

Parsimony analyses of combined data sets resulted in a single most parsimonious tree, which was very similar to the 50\% majority consensus tree from the Bayesian analysis. All nodes except three were supported by more than 50\% bootstrap. The monophyly of Passifloraceae s.l. as well as the former families, Malesherbiaceae, Passifloraceae sensu stricto, and Turneraceae were strongly supported. Passifloraceae s.s. and the Turneraceae are sisters, and form a strongly supported clade. Within Passifloraceae s.s., the tribes Passifloreae and Paropsieae are both monophyletic. The intergeneric relationships within Passifloraceae s.s. and Turneraceae are roughly correlated with previous classification systems. The morphological character of an androgynophore/gynophore is better used for characterizing genera grouping within Passifloraceae s.s. Other morphological characters such as the corona and aril are discussed.},

	abstract = {The four species of the central African genus Barteria show variation in habitat and in degree of association with ants. Whereas B. solida, restricted to submontane forests, attracts opportunistic ants to extrafloral nectar, the three other species, found in lowland rainforests (B. fistulosa, B. dewevrei) and in littoral scrub (B. nigritana), possess stem domatia of varying shapes and degrees of specialisation, hosting either non-specific arboreal ants (B. nigritana, some B. dewevrei) or two large species of ants of the genus Tetraponera Smith, 1852 that are specific to some species of Barteria (B. fistulosa, some B. dewevrei). We aimed to investigate whether this variation represents an evolutionary trend toward increasing specialisation of mutualism or the reduction or loss of myrmecophytic traits. For this, we determined phylogenetic relationships within the genus using DNA sequences (primarily nuclear ITS) and microsatellite genotypes (11 loci) on a large sample of individuals, mostly from Cameroon and Gabon. The two types of markers support an initial dichotomy that groups B. dewevrei with B. nigritana and B. fistulosa with B. solida respectively. Within these pairs, species do not appear reciprocally monophyletic. At microsatellite loci, B. nigritana forms a clade embedded within B. dewevrei; and within both B. solida and B. fistulosa, geographical populations show levels of differentiation similar to that observed between populations of B. solida and B. fistulosa. Geographic distance alone does not account for genetic differentiation between species, which indicates reproductive isolation. Divergence in each of the two pairs implies evolutionary transitions in habitat and in myrmecophytism. Specialised mutualism with specific ant species of the genus Tetraponera has been lost in species found in more marginal habitats.},

METHODS Two molecular data sets were used individually and combined and included sequences from the internally transcribed spacer region (ITS) of 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA and the trnL intron and the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer region of plastid DNA. KEY RESULTS Parsimony analysis demonstrated that the genus is not monophyletic unless the closely related Roemeria, Stylomecon and Meconopsis cambrica are included in a revised circumscription of Papaver. Three distinct clades are resolved in a combined ITS and trnL-F analysis. Clade 1 consists of Papaver sect. Meconella and Asian Meconopsis. Clade 2 contains a group here identified as Papaver s.s., comprising sections Carinatae, Meconidium, Oxytona, Papaver, Pilosa, Pseudopilosa and Rhoeadium. Clade 3 consists of Papaver sect. Argemonidium and Roemeria refracta. A number of diagnostic indels support these groupings. Within clade 2, sects. Papaver and Rhoeadium are either not monophyletic or lack evidence supporting their monophyly. CONCLUSIONS The results of this molecular analysis indicate that a number of morphological characters such as valvate capsule dehiscence, dark or light filaments and sessile stigmatic discs have arisen in parallel. The phylogenetic trees are incongruent with the existing taxonomy of Papaver, and a revised classification is suggested.},

	abstract = {Pandanaceae (screwpines) is a monocot family composed of c. 750 species widely distributed in the Paleotropics. It has been proposed that the family may have a Gondwanan origin with an extant Paleotropical distribution resulting from the breakup of that supercontinent. However, fossils supporting that hypothesis have been recently reassigned to other families while new fossil discoveries suggest an alternate hypothesis. In the present study, nuclear and chloroplast sequences were used to resolve relationships among Pandanaceae genera. Two well-supported fossils were used to produce a chronogram to infer whether the age of major intra-familial lineages corresponds with the breakup of Gondwana. The Pandanaceae has a Late Cretaceous origin, and genera on former Gondwanan landmasses began to diverge in the Late Eocene, well after many of the southern hemisphere continents became isolated. The results suggest an extant distribution influenced by long-distance-dispersal. The most widespread group within the family, the Pandanus tectorius species complex, originated in Eastern Queensland within the past six million years and has spread to encompass nearly the entire geographic extent of the family from Africa through Polynesia. The spread of that group is likely due to dispersal via hydrochory as well as a combination of traits such as agamospermy, anemophily, and multi-seeded propagules which can facilitate the establishment of new populations in remote locations.},

	abstract = {According to the present taxonomical treatment, Paeonia subsect. Delavayanae consists of only two species (P. delavayi and P. ludlowii) endemic to the Himalayan-Hengduan Mountains. Although P. ludlowii can be distinguished from P. delavayi on the basis of a series of morphological characters, the species delimitation remains controversial because the more widespread one, P. delavayi, exhibits considerable morphological diversity. Both chloroplast DNA markers and nuclear microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (nSSR) are used herein to reveal genetic diversity and relationships of the two taxa included in this subsection, and ecological niche modeling (ENM) is employed to get insights into their paleodistribution. Our results show that genetic boundaries between the two currently recognized species are unclear, probably due to recent divergence. Paeonia ludlowii is budding from P. delavayi, probably by genetic isolation but also by shifting its niche to the harsher upland Tibetan conditions. Paeonia delavayi itself would be, however, under active speciation, showing significant genetic differentiation and morphological diversity. Whereas P. ludlowii would have endured the Pleistocene glacial periods by in situ persistence in local, small refugia, a 'dual' model seems to apply for P. delavayi (in situ persistence and retreat to refugia). The rarity of P. ludlowii and high evolutionary potential of P. delavayi imply high priority for in situ conservation of both taxa. The Himalayan-Hengduan Mountains are an ideal arena for differentiation within subsect. Delavayanae of Paeonia, by means of expansions/contractions/displacements, vertical migrations, and local survival/extinctions in response to the Neogene climate fluctuations and geological changes.},

	abstract = {The nuclear-encoded chloroplast-expressed glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) gene has been found to be single-copy in a number of angiosperm families. In this study we investigated the phylogenetic utility of the GPAT gene at the interspecific level using the genus Paeonia (Paeoniaceae) as an example. An approximately 2.3- to 2.6-kb fragment of the GPAT gene, containing a large intron of more than 2 kb, was amplified, cloned, and sequenced from 19 accessions representing 13 Paeonia species. The GPAT gene phylogeny inferred by parsimony analysis supported interspecific relationships that were previously unresolved, suggesting that large introns of low-copy nuclear genes are particularly informative in the resolution of close relationships at low taxonomic levels. Whereas the GPAT phylogeny is largely congruent with the previous phylogenetic hypothesis of Paeonia, it shows a significant discordance involving the paraphyly of section Paeonia. Given evidence of an ancient duplication and the subsequent silencing of one GPAT locus in P. anomala, this discordance is most likely the result of paralogy. Two distinct genomic clones containing partial GPAT genes were isolated from P. anomala. The GPAT sequence from one clone corresponded to the functional copy of the gene, and the second genomic clone was determined to contain a GPAT pseudogene. The insertion of a retrotransposon in an intron of this pseudogene may have been responsible for the silencing of this GPAT locus in P. anomala. This study suggests that, although it is unlikely that universal nuclear gene markers free from paralogy are usually available, low-copy nuclear genes can be very useful in plant phylogenetic reconstruction, especially at low taxonomic levels, as long as the evolutionary dynamics of the genes are carefully examined.},

Several species in section Corniculatae share a base chromosome number x=5 with species in section Ripariae, while other species in the former have a x=6. We used a molecular and cytogenetic approach to determine the phylogenetic relationships, test the previous taxonomic classification and study the genome rearrangements that led to the differences in chromosome size and basic chromosome number between both sections. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred based on DNA sequences from chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal ITS. The molecular phylogenetic analyses found that neither of the sections are monophyletic, but do support two clades. The first group contains diploid species with x=5, large chromosomes and high DNA content and the second diploid and polyploidy species with x=6, small chromosomes and low DNA content. The x=5 clade comprises species of both sections, while the x=6 clade was formed mainly by section Corniculatae species and O. serpens from section Ripariae. Our results suggest that x=5 and high DNA content are derived conditions, which may have resulted from descendent disploidy and proliferation of transposable elements. Thus, cytogenetic data superimposed on the phylogeny have shown two different modes of chromosome evolution in both lineages: (1) chromosome rearrangements and increase in genome size in the x=5 lineage and (2) polyploidy playing the main role in chromosome evolution among species in the x=6 species. A taxonomic revision for the two sections is suggested.},

We test the relationships between the two major groups of bulbous Oxalis taxa, namely the southern African lineage which is centered in the speciose Cape Floristic Region (CFR), and the New World section Ionoxalis, by including the rhizomatous geophyte Oxalis acetosella, the caudiciform stem succulent Oxalis articulata, and the rhizomiform pseudobulbous Oxalis triangularis, in combined phylogenetic analyses of nrITS and trnL-F sequence data. We optimize several key bulbous characters in ancestral state reconstructions on produced phylogenies. Results of our analyses indicate that the evolution of bulbous characters in the genus is more complex than previously thought. Although the two major bulb types are homologous, the rhizomiform pseudobulbous habit arises from within true bulbs, and in most reconstructions the caudiciform stem succulent O. articulata is inferred to have secondarily lost several distinctive bulbous characters. O. acetosella is not as closely related to the bulbous lineage as previously thought. More sampling from other key taxa are needed before the order in which key bulbous characters were acquired can be verified. We discuss these results in terms of the taxonomic and ecological implications for the CFR Oxalis taxa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The southern African Oxalis radiation is extremely morphologically variable. Despite recent progress in the phylogenetics of the genus, there are few morphological synapomorphies supporting DNA-based clades. Leaflet anatomy can provide an understudied and potentially valuable source of information on the evolutionary history and systematics of this lineage. Fifty-nine leaflet anatomical traits of 109 southern African Oxalis species were assessed in search of phylogenetically significant characters that delineate clades. RESULTS A combination of 6 leaflet anatomical traits (stomatal position, adaxial epidermal cells, abaxial epidermal cells, mesophyll, sheath around vascular tissue, degree of leaflet conduplication) clearly support various clades defined by previous DNA-based phylogenetic work. Other, mostly continuous leaflet anatomical traits were highly variable and showed less phylogenetic pattern. CONCLUSIONS Major and unexpected findings include the transition from ancestral hypostomatic leaflets to adaxially-located stomata in the vast majority of southern African Oxalis, the loss of semi-swollen AB epidermal cells and the gain of swollen adaxial and abaxial epidermal cells in selected clades, and multiple changes from ancestral bifacial mesophyll to isobilateral or homogenous mesophyll types. The information gathered in this study will aid in the taxonomic revision of this speciose member of the Greater Cape Floristic Region and provide a basis for future hypotheses regarding its radiation.},

	abstract = {Among the World's most challenging environments for plant life is the Atacama Desert, an arid zone extending over 1300 km and from sea level to 2000/3000 m altitude along the southwestern Andean foothills. Plants there and in the adjacent Mediterranean zone exhibit striking adaptations, and we here address the question whether in a species-rich clade such adaptations arose in parallel, at different times, or simultaneously. Answering this type of question has been a major concern of evolutionary biology over the past few years, with a growing consensus that lineages tend to be conservative in their vegetative traits and niche requirements. Combined nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences for 112 species of Oxalidales (4900 aligned nucleotides) were used for a fossil-calibrated phylogeny that includes 43 of the 54 species of Chilean Oxalis, and species distribution models (SDMs) incorporating precipitation, temperature, and fog, and the phylogeny were used to reconstruct ancestral habitat preferences, relying on likelihood and Bayesian techniques. Since uneven collecting can reduce the power of SDMs, we compared 3 strategies to correct for collecting effort. Unexpectedly, the Oxalis flora of Chile consists of 7 distant lineages that originated at different times prior to the last Andean uplift pulse; some had features preadapting them to seasonally arid or xeric conditions. Models that incorporated fog and a "collecting activity surface" performed best and identified the Mediterranean zone as a hotspot of Oxalis species as well as lineage diversity because it harbors a mix of ancient and young groups, including insufficiently arid-adapted species. There is no evidence of rapid adaptive radiation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The classification of royal ferns (Osmundaceae) has long remained controversial. Recent molecular phylogenies indicate that Osmunda is paraphyletic and needs to be separated into Osmundastrum and Osmunda s.str. Here, however, we describe an exquisitely preserved Jurassic Osmunda rhizome (O. pulchella sp. nov.) that combines diagnostic features of both Osmundastrum and Osmunda, calling molecular evidence for paraphyly into question. We assembled a new morphological matrix based on rhizome anatomy, and used network analyses to establish phylogenetic relationships between fossil and extant members of modern Osmundaceae. We re-analysed the original molecular data to evaluate root-placement support. Finally, we integrated morphological and molecular data-sets using the evolutionary placement algorithm. RESULTS Osmunda pulchella and five additional Jurassic rhizome species show anatomical character suites intermediate between Osmundastrum and Osmunda. Molecular evidence for paraphyly is ambiguous: a previously unrecognized signal from spacer sequences favours an alternative root placement that would resolve Osmunda s.l. as monophyletic. Our evolutionary placement analysis identifies fossil species as probable ancestral members of modern genera and subgenera, which accords with recent evidence from Bayesian dating. CONCLUSIONS Osmunda pulchella is likely a precursor of the Osmundastrum lineage. The recently proposed root placement in Osmundaceae-based solely on molecular data-stems from possibly misinformative outgroup signals in rbcL and atpA genes. We conclude that the seemingly conflicting evidence from morphological, anatomical, molecular, and palaeontological data can instead be elegantly reconciled under the assumption that Osmunda is indeed monophyletic.},

In this study, we aim to reconstruct a comprehensive phylogeny of section Cyathophora, and compare phylogenetic incongruence between nuclear and chloroplast datasets. Sixty-seven accessions belonging to section Cyathophora and 9 species for other Pedicularis were sampled, and one nuclear gene (nrITS) and four chloroplast genes (matK, rbcL, trnH-psbA and trnL-F) were sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses show that the topologies and networks inferred from nrITS and the concatenated chloroplast datasets were incongruent, and the nrITS phylogenies and network agreed with the morphology-based taxonomy to some degree. The chloroplast genome of two Sichuan samples of P. cyathophylloides (E4 and E5) may show introgression from an ancestor of P. cyathophylla. Neither the nrITS dataset nor the concatenated chloroplast dataset were able to adequately resolve relationships among species in the series Reges; this is most likely due to incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgression/hybridization. The nrITS phylogeny indicates the beakless (toothed and toothless) and beaked galeas may have evolved independently within section Cyathophora, and the chloroplast phylogeny reveals that the long corolla tube with beaked galea is derived from the short one.},

Cyathophora of Pedicularis, one of the most species-rich genera of angiosperms in the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, as a model to investigate the efficiency of RNA-seq in resolving relationships of closely related congeneric species. Flower transcriptomes were sequenced for all species of sect. Cyathophora and two outgroup species. Forty-one highly conserved single-/low-copy nuclear genes and 1553 orthologous groups (OGs) were identified and concatenated into five datasets based on gene copy numbers and Ka/Ks values to reconstruct the phylogeny of section Cyathophora. We also tested how many genes minimally can resolve the interspecific relationships, and reconstructed the evolutionary history of some floral characters in sect. Cyathophora. The results showed that the five different datasets consistently resolved the interspecific relationships of sect. Cyathophora, and the interspecific relationships can be robustly reconstructed with maximal support when ⩾20 single-/low-copy nuclear genes or 25 OGs are used. Our study suggests that all OGs under different selective pressures can be concatenated for phylogenomic reconstruction, and provides a successful and efficient use of RNA-seq in reconstructing interspecific relationships of a non-model plant group with recent radiations.},

	abstract = {The origin of the arctic flora covering the northernmost treeless areas is still poorly understood. Arctic plants may have evolved in situ or immigrated from the adjacent ecosystems. Frequently arctic species have disjunctive distributions between the Arctic and high mountain systems of the temperate zone. This pattern may result from long distance dispersal or from glacial plant migrations and extinctions of intermediate populations. The hemiparasitic genus Pedicularis is represented in the Arctic by c. 28 taxa and ranks among the six most species-rich vascular plant genera of this region. In this study, we test the hypothesis that these lineages evolved from predecessors occurring in northern temperate mountain ranges, many of which are current centers of diversity for the genus. We generated a nuclear ribosomal and chloroplast DNA phylogeny including almost all of the arctic taxa and nearly half of the genus as a whole. The arctic taxa of Pedicularis evolved 12-14 times independently and are mostly nested in lineages that otherwise occur in the high mountains of Eurasia and North America. It appears that only three arctic lineages arose from the present-day center of diversity of the genus, in the Hengduan Mountains and Himalayas. Two lineages are probably of lowland origin. Arctic taxa of Pedicularis show considerable niche conservatism with respect to soil moisture and grow predominantly in moist to wet soils. The studied characteristics of ecology, morphology, and chromosome numbers of arctic Pedicularis show a heterogeneous pattern of evolution. The directions of morphological changes among the arctic lineages show opposing trends. Arctic taxa are chiefly diploid, the few tetraploid chromosome numbers of the genus were recorded only for arctic taxa. Five arctic Pedicularis are annuals or biennials, life forms otherwise rare in the Arctic. Other genera of the Orobanchaceae consist also of an elevated number of short-lived species, thus hemiparasitism may favor this life form in the Arctic.},

Phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast and nuclear DNA regions revealed a complex history for the origin and diversification of annual Castilleja species in South America. In addition to at least three independent long-distance dispersal events from North America, allopolyploidy has played a significant role in this disjunct radiation. Only C. attenuata occurs in both California and South America, and these results support its recent arrival to central Chile. Two Peruvian species are inferred to be allopolyploids; hybridization between annual lineages derived from independent long-distance dispersal events from North America gave rise to C. profunda, and hybridization between South American annual and perennial species gave rise to C. cerroana.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis of two chloroplast (rps16 and trnL/F) and two nuclear ribosomal (internal and external transcribed spacers) DNA regions support the monophyly of subtribe Castillejinae (Orobanchaceae). A well-supported phylogeny of the six genera (Castilleja [∼180 spp.], Clevelandia [1 sp.], Cordylanthus [18 spp.], Ophiocephalus [1 sp.], Orthocarpus [9 spp.], and Triphysaria [5 spp.]) comprising the subtribe is presented, and morphological synapomorphies are identified for the major lineages recovered. Orthocarpus and Triphysaria are both monophyletic; Cordylanthus is biphyletic. Clevelandia and Ophiocephalus are derived from within Castilleja. The perennial Castilleja clade (∼160 spp.) is derived from a grade of annual taxa including Castilleja sect. Oncorhynchus (16 spp.), Cordylanthus, Orthocarpus, and Triphysaria. This suggests that the perennial habit evolved a single time from an annual ancestral lineage that persisted throughout the diversification of Castillejinae, contrary to classical interpretations of life history evolution in plants. Given the prevalence of polyploidy among perennial Castilleja species, perenniality may have played an important role in the origin and establishment of polyploidy in Castilleja.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Little is known of the evolutionary relationships within Conopholis, a small holoparasitic genus belonging to the broomrape family. Presently, Conopholis is described as having two species, C. americana and C. alpina. This classification is based on a combination of presence/absence of morphological characters along with a number of quantitative traits. We assessed the relationships among populations and species of this genus to determine whether the present taxonomic hypothesis is reflected in molecular phylogenies. METHODS We conducted the first phylogenetic study of Conopholis using plastid (trnfM-E intergenic spacer and clpP gene/introns) and nuclear (PHYA intron 1) sequences from a wide taxonomic sampling covering its entire geographical range in North America. Analyses were carried out using a variety of phylogenetic inference approaches. KEY RESULTS Reciprocal monophyly between the two traditionally accepted species has not yet been achieved. Instead, three distinct genetic clusters were recovered. Conopholis alpina is clearly paraphyletic and shows evidence of belonging to at least two distinct lineages. Specimens found in Costa Rica and Panama form a distinct group from those located in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. The monophyly of C. americana was also not recovered; however, the possibility of it being monophyletic could not be rejected with confidence. CONCLUSIONS These analyses recovered three distinct lineages indicating that there could be a minimum of three species within the genus. A reevaluation of morphological features within Conopholis may reveal shared features that could further corroborate our molecular findings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND North American Agalinis Raf. species represent a taxonomically challenging group and there have been extensive historical revisions at the species, section, and subsection levels of classification. The genus contains many rare species, including the federally listed endangered species Agalinis acuta. In addition to evaluating the degree to which historical classifications at the section and subsection levels are supported by molecular data sampled from 79 individuals representing 29 Agalinis species, we assessed the monophyly of 27 species by sampling multiple individuals representing different populations of those species. Twenty-one of these species are of conservation concern in at least some part of their range. RESULTS Phylogenetic relationships estimated using maximum likelihood analyses of seven chloroplast DNA loci (aligned length = 11,076 base pairs (bp) and the nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS (internal transcribed spacer) locus (733 bp); indicated no support for the historically recognized sections except for Section Erectae. Our results suggest that North American members of the genus comprise six major lineages, however we were not able to resolve branching order among many of these lineages. Monophyly of 24 of the 29 sampled species was supported based on significant branch lengths of and high bootstrap support for subtending branches. However, there was no statistical support for the monophyly of A. acuta with respect to Agalinis tenella and Agalinis decemloba. Although most species were supported, deeper relationships among many species remain ambiguous. CONCLUSION The North American Agalinis species sampled form a well supported, monophyletic group within the family Orobanchaceae relative to the outgroups sampled. Most hypotheses regarding section- and subsection-level relationships based on morphology were not supported and taxonomic revisions are warranted. Lack of support for monophyly of Agalinis acuta leaves the important question regarding its taxonomic status unanswered. Lack of resolution is potentially due to incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms among recently diverged species; however the gene regions examined did distinguish among almost all other species in the genus. Due to the important policy implications of this finding we are further evaluating the evolutionary distinctiveness of A. acuta using morphological data and loci with higher mutation rates.},

We report on HGT of a plastid region including rps2, trnL-F, and rbcL in a group of non-photosynthetic flowering plants. Species of the parasitic broomrape genus Phelipanche harbor two copies of rps2, a plastid ribosomal gene, one corresponding to the phylogenetic position of the respective species, the other being horizontally acquired from the related broomrape genus Orobanche. While the vertically transmitted copies probably reside within the plastid genome, the localization of the horizontally acquired copies is not known. With both donor and recipient being parasitic plants, a possible pathway for the exchange of genetic material is via a commonly attacked host.},

This concerns both the phylogenetic relationships within the genus, in particular its monophyly or lack thereof, and the relationships to other holoparasitic genera such as Cistanche or Conopholis. Here we present the first comprehensive phylogenetic study of this group based on a region from the plastid genome (rps2 gene). Although substitution rates appear to be elevated compared to the photosynthetic members of Orobanchaceae, relationships among the major lineages Cistanche, Conopholis plus Epifagus, Boschniakia rossica (Cham. \& Schltdl.) B. Fedtsch., B. himalaica Hook. f. \& Thomson, B. hookeri Walp. plus B. strobilacea A. Gray, and Orobanche s. l. remain unresolved. Resolution within Orobanche, however, is much better. In agreement with morphological, cytological and other molecular phylogenetic evidence, five lineages, corresponding to the four traditionally recognised sections (Gymnocaulis, Myzorrhiza, Orobanche, Trionychon) and O. latisquama Reut. ex Boiss. (of sect. Orobanche), can be distinguished. A combined analysis of plastid rps2 and nuclear ITS sequences of the holoparasitic genera results in more resolved and better supported trees, although the relationships among Orobanche s. l., Cistanche, and the clade including the remaining genera is unresolved. Therefore, rps2 is a marker from the plastid genome that is well-suited to be used in combination with other already established nuclear markers for resolving generic relationships of Orobanche and related genera.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE Orobanchaceae are a family of angiosperms that range from fully autotrophic and free-living to completely heterotrophic and dependent on their hosts (holoparasites). Most of the ca. 2060 species are hemiparasites that photosynthesize throughout all or part of their life cycles. Certain family members are ecologically important due to direct impacts on community biomass and diversity, plant-herbivore interactions, and nutrient cycling. Other members are among the most economically damaging weeds in the world. Multiple trophic transitions within this family make it ideal for studying molecular evolutionary and physiological changes that accompany the evolution of parasitism. • METHODS To establish a phylogenetic framework for such work, we substantially increased taxonomic sampling at loci for which a significant amount of data already existed (nuclear ITS and PHYA, plastid matK and rps2) and added data from the low-copy nuclear locus, PHYB. • KEY RESULTS The data provide strong support for relationships among six major clades and for the position of Brandisia hancei Hook. f. The positions of Boschniakia himalaica Hook. f. \& Thomson, Centranthera cochinchinensis (Lour.) Merr., Mannagettaea hummelii Harry Sm., and Pterygiella nigrescens Oliv. are confirmed or suggested for the first time. • CONCLUSIONS There is a single origin of parasitism, and from within the hemiparasites, holoparasitism has originated three times. Moving from the base to the tips of the Orobanchaceae tree, the successive major splits within the parasitic clade are: Cymbarieae + the rest; Orobancheae + the rest; Brandisia + the rest; Rhinantheae + the rest; and Pedicularideae + Buchnereae.},

	abstract = {The rbcL sequences of 106 specimens representing 28 species of the four recognized sections of Orobanche were analyzed and compared. Most sequences represent pseudogenes with premature stop codons. This study confirms that the American lineage (sects. Gymnocaulis and Myzorrhiza) contains potentially functional rbcL-copies with intact open reading frames and low rates of non-synonymous substitutions. For the first time, this is also shown for a member of the Eurasian lineage, O. coerulescens of sect. Orobanche, while all other investigated species of sects. Orobanche and Trionychon contain pseudogenes with distorted reading frames and significantly higher rates of non-synonymous substitutions. Phylogenetic analyses of the rbcL sequences give equivocal results concerning the monophyly of Orobanche, and the American lineage might be more closely related to Boschniakia and Cistanche than to the other sections of Orobanche. Additionally, species of sect. Trionychon phylogenetically nest in sect. Orobanche. This is in concordance with results from other plastid markers (rps2 and matK), but in disagreement with other molecular (nuclear ITS), morphological, and karyological data. This might indicate that the ancestor of sect. Trionychon has captured the plastid genome, or parts of it, of a member of sect. Orobanche. Apart from the phylogenetically problematic position of sect. Trionychon, the phylogenetic relationships within sect. Orobanche are similar to those inferred from nuclear ITS data and are close to the traditional groupings traditionally recognized based on morphology. The intraspecific variation of rbcL is low and is neither correlated with intraspecific morphological variability nor with host range. Ancestral character reconstruction using parsimony suggests that the ancestor of O. sect. Orobanche had a narrow host range.},

The disjunction is coupled with strikingly contrasting patterns of morphological diversity between the southern and northern hemispheres, making it an exciting model to study processes of evolutionary diversification which shaped present floras. We inferred the relationships among 51 species representing 14 of the 15 sections of the genus based on nrDNA ITS and cpDNA trnL intron, trnL-trnF and atpB-rbcL intergenic spacers. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference support monophyly of the genus and of several intrageneric groups characterized by morphology, ploidy level, and geographic range. Molecular phylogenetic dating using Bayesian "relaxed" clock methods suggests that the earliest Euphrasia radiations occurred minimum 11-8 Mya with bipolarity being achieved 7-5 Mya. Biogeographic analyses using explicit model-based approach inferred Eurasia as an ancestral area for the genus. The most parsimonious reconstruction found by a dispersal-vicariance analysis requires 17 dispersals to account for the current biogeographic pattern and supports Eurasian origin for Euphrasia. Both long-distance dispersal and across land vicariance can be invoked to explain the diversification in the genus, which experienced rapid radiations driven by new ecological opportunities of the late Pliocene and Pleistocene but also retained a set of local endemic or relict species of an earlier origin.},

	abstract = {The biogeography of Mediterranean groups is very heterogeneous, because of the complex geologic and climatic history of the region. Our goal was to reconstruct the spatio-temporal history of the genus Odontites. In particular, we aimed to infer its area of origin and colonization routes, investigate its timing of diversification, and examine possible correlations with major environmental events. Based on sequencing of three chloroplast markers (psbA-trnH, trnL-trnF and trnC-ycf6), we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among species. We performed molecular dating analyses (based on a large-scale rbcL dataset), ancestral areas reconstructions, and interpreted the observed patterns in the light of the complex geologic and climatic histories of the region. Our results suggested that Bartsiella and Bornmuellerantha should be reintegrated into Odontites s.l. The genus originated in the Iberian Peninsula ca. 18.9Ma and diverged into two main clades 16.2Ma, but species diversification was most intense {\textless}5-6Ma. The two clades showed a clear geographic pattern: one clade originated in the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco, and extended its range to Eastern North Africa and the central Mediterranean Basin; the other clade originated in Europe and Western Asia, and mostly diversified within this ancestral area. The eastward colonization of the Mediterranean Basin contrasts with many other plant groups. Nevertheless, the burst of diversification in the Plio-Pleistocene agrees with what has been reported for other groups, and is concomitant with the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis, onset of the Mediterranean climate and Quaternary glaciations. The link between phylogeny and geography suggests limited dispersal, and most dispersal events may have occurred overland rather than overseas.},

Here we explore the use of reduced-representation genome sequencing, specifically in the form of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD), for phylogenetic inference and the detection of ancestral hybridization in non-model organisms. As a case study, we investigate Pedicularis section Cyathophora, a systematically recalcitrant clade of flowering plants in the broomrape family (Orobanchaceae). Two methods of phylogenetic inference, maximum likelihood and Bayesian concordance, were applied to data sets that included as many as 40,000 RAD loci. Both methods yielded similar topologies that included two major clades: a "rex-thamnophila" clade, composed of two species and several subspecies with relatively low floral diversity, and geographically widespread distributions at lower elevations, and a "superba" clade, composed of three species characterized by relatively high floral diversity and isolated geographic distributions at higher elevations. Levels of molecular divergence between subspecies in the rex-thamnophila clade are similar to those between species in the superba clade. Using Patterson's D-statistic test, including a novel extension of the method that enables finer-grained resolution of introgression among multiple candidate taxa by removing the effect of their shared ancestry, we detect significant introgression among nearly all taxa in the rex-thamnophila clade, but not between clades or among taxa within the superba clade. These results suggest an important role for geographic isolation in the emergence of species barriers, by facilitating local adaptation and differentiation in the absence of homogenizing gene flow.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The Aerides-Vanda alliance is a complex group in the subtribe Aeridinae (subfamily Epidendroideae, Orchidaceae). Some phylogenetic systems of this alliance have been previously proposed based on molecular and morphological analyses. However, several taxonomic problems within this alliance as well as between it and its allies remain unsolved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We utilized ITS and five plastid DNA regions in this phylogenetic analysis. Consensus trees strongly indicate that the Aerides-Vanda alliance is monophyletic, and the 14 genera of this alliance can be grouped into the following clades with 14 subclades: 1. Aerides, comprising two subclades: Rhynchostylis and Aerides; 2. Ascocentropsis; 3. Papilionanthe; 4. Vanda, comprising five subclades: Neofinetia, Christensonia, Seidenfadenia, Ascocentrum, and Vanda-Trudelia, in which Vanda and Trudelia form a subclade; 5. Tsiorchis, comprising three subclades: Chenorchis, Tsiorchis, and two species of Ascocentrum; 6. Paraholcoglossum; and 7. Holcoglossum. Among the 14 genera, only Ascocentrum is triphyletic: two species of the Ascocentrum subclade, an independent subclade Ascocentrum subclade in the Tsiorchis clade; the Ascocentrum subclade in the Vanda clade; and one species in the Holcoglossum clade. The Vanda and Trudelia species belong to the same subclade. The molecular conclusion is consistent with their morphological characteristics. CONCLUSIONS We elucidate the relationship among the 14 genera of the Aerides-Vanda alliance. Our phylogenetic results reveal that the Aerides-Vanda alliance is monophyletic, but it can be divided into 14 genera. The data prove that Ascocentrum is triphyletic. Plants with elongate-terete leaves and small flowers should be treated as a new genus, Pendulorchis. Saccolabium himalaicum (Ascocentrum himalaicum) should be transferred to Pendulorchis. Ascocentrum pumilum, endemic to Taiwan, should be transferred to Holcoglossum. A new combination, Holcoglossum pumilum, was also established. Trudelia should not be recognized as an independent genus. Two new species, Pendulorchis gaoligongensis and Holcoglossum singchianum, were described as well.},

In Phaius, a total of three species, P. flavus, P. columnaris, and P. takeoi, were segregated to form a new genus, Paraphaius. In Calanthe, subgenus Preptanthe and sect. Styloglossum were both categorized as distinct genera from Calanthe. Our results also confirm that Calanthe delavayi and C. calanthoides are members of Calanthe. Previous studies assigned C. delavayi to Phaius and C. calanthoides to Ghiesbrechtia. Five sections, namely, Alpinocalanthe, Puberula, Ghiesbrechtia, Tricarinata, and Calanthe, three of which are new taxa, were recognized in Calanthe. Therefore, we propose that the Calanthe alliance is composed of six genera: Calanthe, Cephalantheropsis, Paraphaius, Phaius, Preptanthe and Styloglossum.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Orchids have numerous species, and their speciation rates are presumed to be exceptionally high, suggesting that orchids are continuously and actively evolving. The wide diversity of orchids has attracted the interest of evolutionary biologists. In this study, a new orchid was discovered on Danxia Mountain in Guangdong, China. However, the phylogenetic clarification of this new orchid requires further molecular, morphological, and phytogeographic analyses. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS A new orchid possesses a labellum with a large Y-shaped callus and two sacs at the base, and cylindrical, fleshy seeds, which make it distinct from all known orchid genera. Phylogenetic methods were applied to a matrix of morphological and molecular characters based on the fragments of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer, chloroplast matK, and rbcL genes of Orchidaceae (74 genera) and Calypsoeae (13 genera). The strict consensus Bayesian inference phylogram strongly supports the division of the Calypsoeae alliance (not including Dactylostalix and Ephippianthus) into seven clades with 11 genera. The sequence data of each species and the morphological characters of each genus were combined into a single dataset. The inferred Bayesian phylogram supports the division of the 13 genera of Calypsoeae into four clades with 13 subclades (genera). Based on the results of our phylogenetic analyses, Calypsoeae, under which the new orchid is classified, represents an independent lineage in the Epidendroideae subfamily. CONCLUSIONS Analyses of the combined datasets using Bayesian methods revealed strong evidence that Calypsoeae is a monophyletic tribe consisting of eight well-supported clades with 13 subclades (genera), which are all in agreement with the phytogeography of Calypsoeae. The Danxia orchid represents an independent lineage under the tribe Calypsoeae of the subfamily Epidendroideae. This lineage should be treated as a new genus, which we have named Danxiaorchis, that is parallel to Yoania. Both genera are placed under the subtribe Yoaniinae.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Cymbidium orchids, including some 50 species, are the famous flowers, and they possess high commercial value in the floricultural industry. Furthermore, the values of different orchids are great differences. However, species identification is very difficult. To a certain degree, chloroplast DNA sequence data are a versatile tool for species identification and phylogenetic implications in plants. Different chloroplast loci have been utilized for evaluating phylogenetic relationships at each classification level among plant species, including at the interspecies and intraspecies levels. However, there is no evidence that a short sequence can distinguish all plant species from each other in order to infer phylogenetic relationships. Molecular markers derived from the complete chloroplast genome can provide effective tools for species identification and phylogenetic resolution. RESULTS The complete nucleotide sequences of eight individuals from a total of five Cymbidium species' chloroplast (cp) genomes were determined using Illumina sequencing technology of the total DNA via a combination of de novo and reference-guided assembly. The length of the Cymbidium cp genome is about 155 kb. The cp genomes contain 123 unique genes, and the IR regions contain 24 duplicates. Although the genomes, including genome structure, gene order and orientation, are similar to those of other orchids, they are not evolutionarily conservative. The cp genome of Cymbidium evolved moderately with more than 3\% sequence divergence, which could provide enough information for phylogeny. Rapidly evolving chloroplast genome regions were identified and 11 new divergence hotspot regions were disclosed for further phylogenetic study and species identification in Orchidaceae. CONCLUSIONS Phylogenomic analyses were conducted using 10 complete chloroplast genomes from seven orchid species. These data accurately identified the individuals and established the phylogenetic relationships between the species. The results reveal that phylogenomics based on organelle genome sequencing lights the species identification-organelle-scale "barcodes", and is also an effective approach for studying whole populations and phylogenetic characteristics of Cymbidium.},

Based on five DNA markers and a broad sampling of Dendrobium and its relatives from mainland Asia (109 species), our results indicate that mainland Asia Dendrobium is divided into eight clades (with two unplaced species) that form polytomies along the spine of the cladogram. Both Dendrobium and Epigeneium are well supported as monophyletic, whereas sect. Dendrobium, sect. Densiflora, sect. Breviflores, sect. Holochrysa, are paraphyletic/polyphyletic. Many ignored phylogenetic relationships, such as the one of major clades formed by D. jenkinsii and D. lindleyi (two members of sect. Densiflora), the Aphyllum group, the Devonianum group, the Catenatum group, the Crepidatum group, and the Dendrobium moniliforme complex are well supported by both molecular and morphological evidence. Based on our data, we propose to broaden sect. Dendrobium to include sect. Stuposa, sect. Breviflores, and sect. Holochrysa and to establish a new section to accommodate D. jenkinsii and D. lindleyi. Our results indicated that it is preferable to use a broad generic concept of Dendrobium and to pursue an improved infrageneric classification at sectional level, taking into account both morphology and current molecular findings.},

Collabieae (including the previously misplaced mycoheterotrophic Risleya) is supported as monophyletic and nested within a superclade that also includes Epidendreae, Podochileae, Cymbidieae and Vandeae. Risleya is nested in Collabiinae and sister to Chrysoglossum, a relationship which, despite their great vegetative differences, is supported by floral characters. Ania is a distinct genus supported by both morphological and molecular evidence, while redefined Tainia includes Nephelaphyllum and Mischobulbum. Calanthe is paraphyletic and consists four clades; the genera Gastrorchis, Phaius and Cephalantheropsis should be subsumed within Calanthe. Calanthe sect. Ghiesbreghtia is nested within sect.

We analyzed a combined matrix of nrITS DNA, the plastid matK gene and flanking trnK intron, and the plastid atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer for 619 individuals representing ca. 354 species. The plastid rpoC1 gene (ca. 2600 bp) was sequenced for 84 selected species and combined in a more limited analysis with the other data sets to provide greater resolution. In a well-resolved, supported consensus, most clades were present in more than one individual analysis. All the currently recognized minor genera of "core" Maxillariinae (Anthosiphon, Chrysocycnis, Cryptocentrum, Cyrtidiorchis, Mormolyca, Pityphyllum, and Trigonidium) are embedded within a polyphyletic Maxillaria s.l. Our results support the recognition of a more restricted Maxillaria, of some previously published segregate genera (Brasiliorchis, Camaridium, Christensonella, Heterotaxis, Ornithidium, Sauvetrea), and of several novel clades at the generic level. These revised monophyletic generic concepts should minimize further nomenclatural changes, encourage monographic studies, and facilitate more focused analyses of character evolution within Maxillariinae.},

	abstract = {A species tree was reconstructed for the mainly African terrestrial orchid genus Satyrium. Separate phylogenetic analysis of both plastid and ribosomal nuclear DNA sequences for 63 species, revealed extensive topological conflict. Here we describe a detailed protocol to deal with incongruence involving three steps: identifying incongruence and testing its significance, assessing the cause of incongruence, and reconstructing the species tree. The Incongruence Length Difference test revealed that many cases of incongruence were non-significant. For the remaining significant cases, results from taxon jack-knifing experiments and parametric bootstrap suggested that non-biological artefacts such as sparse taxon sampling and long-branch attraction could be excluded as causes for the observed incongruence. In order to evaluate biological causes, such as orthology/paralogy conflation, lineage sorting, and hybridization, the number of events was counted that needs to be invoked a-posteriori to explain the observed pattern. In most cases where incongruence was significant, this resulted in a similar number of events for each of these different causes. Only for the three species from south east Asia, that form a monophyletic clade, hybridization was favoured over the alternative causes. This conclusion is based on the large number of events that needs to be invoked, in order for either orthology/paralogy conflation or lineage sorting to have been the cause of the incongruence+morphological evidence. The final species tree presented here is the product of the combined analysis of plastid and ITS sequences for all non-incongruent species and a-posteriori grafting of the incongruent clades or accessions onto the tree.},

Data were analysed with maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian analysis with mixed models (BA). KEY RESULTS Although relationships between Laeliinae and outgroups are well supported, within the subtribe sequence variation is low considering the broad taxonomic range covered. Localized incongruence between the ITS and plastid trees was found. A combined tree followed the ITS trees more closely, but the levels of support obtained with MP were low. The Bayesian analysis recovered more well-supported nodes. The trees from combined MP and BA allowed eight generic alliances to be recognized within Laeliinae, all of which show trends in morphological characters but lack unambiguous synapomorphies. CONCLUSIONS By using combined plastid and nuclear DNA data in conjunction with mixed-models Bayesian inference, it is possible to delimit smaller groups within Laeliinae and discuss general patterns of pollination and hybridization compatibility. Furthermore, these small groups can now be used for further detailed studies to explain morphological evolution and diversification patterns within the subtribe.},

Despite the absence of boostrap support for some of the relationships, a well-resolved and supported consensus was found, for which most clades were present in more than one individual analysis. Most clades of this consensus attained high posterior probabilities with a Bayesian approach. Circumscription of Arethuseae and Epidendreae are different from most orchid systems based on morphology, but they correspond to a combination of patterns from several less comprehensive orchid phylogenetic analyses previously published. A new circumscription of Epidendreae includes only Neotropical subtribes (Bletiinae, Chysiinae, Laeliinae, Ponerinae, and Pleurothallidinae), whereas Arethuseae include Coelogyninae (all Old World) and Arethusinae (pantropical). Many previously included genera will need to be moved to other tribes. Taxa previously assigned to be Old World Epidendreae are related to different groups of Old World orchids, and this study can serve as a guide for sampling strategies in future studies to resolve troublesome epidendroid orchid clades.},

Results showed that the epiphytic L. fujisanensis is sister to the terrestrial L. koreana and L. kumokiri, while another epiphyte, L. truncata, is sister to the terrestrial L. krameri. Therefore, the two epiphytic species evolved from terrestrial species independently in section Liparis. Comparative seed morphology revealed that the epiphytes have larger embryos than their closely related terrestrial counterparts. A similar trend toward the increase of embryo size in the two epiphytic species belonging to closely related, but distinct clades suggests that the large embryo may have an advantage in the epiphytic lifestyle. The two epiphytic species share another character state, smaller air spaces in the seed than that of closely related terrestrial species, suggesting possible low dispersibility of the epiphytes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Tribe Orchideae dominates the orchid flora of the temperate Northern Hemisphere but its representatives in East Asia had been subject to less intensive phylogenetic study than those in Eurasia and North America. Although this situation was improved recently by the molecular phylogenetic study of Jin et al., comparatively few species were analyzed from the species-rich and taxonomically controversial East Asian Amitostigma alliance. Here, we present a framework nrITS tree of 235 accessions of Orchideae plus an in-depth analysis of 110 representative accessions, encompassing most widely recognized species within the alliance, to elucidate their relationships. RESULTS We used parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian approaches to generate trees from data for two nuclear (nrITS, low-copy Xdh) and four chloroplast (matK, psbA-trnH, trnL-F, trnS-trnG) markers. Nuclear and plastid data were analyzed separately due to a few hard incongruences that most likely reflect chloroplast capture. Our results suggest key phylogenetic placements for Sirindhornia and Brachycorythis, and confirm previous assertions that the Amitostigma alliance is monophyletic and sister to the Eurasian plus European clades of subtribe Orchidinae. Seven robust clades are evident within the alliance, but none corresponds precisely with any of the traditional genera; the smaller and more morphologically distinct genera Tsaiorchis, Hemipilia, Neottianthe and Hemipiliopsis are monophyletic but each is nested within a polyphyletic plexus of species attributed to either Ponerorchis or the most plesiomorphic genus, Amitostigma. Two early-divergent clades that escaped analysis by Jin et al. undermine their attempt to circumscribe an expanded monophyletic genus Ponerorchis. CONCLUSIONS We provide a new framework on the complex phylogenetic relationships between Amitostigma and other genera traditionally included in its alliance; based on which, we combine the entire Amitostigma alliance into a morphologically and molecularly circumscribed Amitostigma sensu latissimo that also contains seven molecularly circumscribed sections. Our molecular trees imply unusually high levels of morphological homoplasy, but these will need to be quantified via a future group-wide review of the alliance based on living plants if morphology is to be fully integrated into our classification.},

	abstract = {It is always difficult to construct coherent classification systems for plant lineages having diverse morphological characters. The genus Dendrobium, one of the largest genera in the Orchidaceae, includes ∼1100 species, and enormous morphological diversification has hindered the establishment of consistent classification systems covering all major groups of this genus. Given the particular importance of species in Dendrobium section Dendrobium and allied groups as floriculture and crude drug genetic resources, there is an urgent need to establish a stable classification system. To clarify phylogenetic relationships in Dendrobium section Dendrobium and allied groups, we analysed the macromolecular characters of the group. Phylogenetic analyses of 210 taxa of Dendrobium were conducted on DNA sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA and the maturase-coding gene (matK) located in an intron of the plastid gene trnK using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods. The parsimony and Bayesian analyses revealed 13 distinct clades in the group comprising section Dendrobium and its allied groups. Results also showed paraphyly or polyphyly of sections Amblyanthus, Aporum, Breviflores, Calcarifera, Crumenata, Dendrobium, Densiflora, Distichophyllae, Dolichocentrum, Holochrysa, Oxyglossum and Pedilonum. On the other hand, the monophyly of section Stachyobium was well supported. It was found that many of the morphological characters that have been believed to reflect phylogenetic relationships are, in fact, the result of convergence. As such, many of the sections that have been recognized up to this point were found to not be monophyletic, so recircumscription of sections is required.},

	abstract = {Since the description of the Neotropical genus Vargasiella in 1952, its taxonomic position has remained unclear, mainly due to a lack of sufficient data. In this study, the taxonomic position of Vargasiella was revised based on the outcomes of macro- and micromorphological studies, analyses of selected molecular markers and ecological methods of niche distribution modeling. The phylogenetic relationships were inferred using three DNA markers: matK, trnL-F and ITS sequences. The morphological studies included the analysis of macromorphological features of herbarium specimens as well as micromorphological examination of preserved flowers. The ecological niche modeling was applied to identify the distribution of the suitable niches of the studied taxa. The relationships between Vargasiella and most similar taxa remain unresolved based on the molecular analysis. The outcomes from the morphological studies indicated significant differences between Vargasiella, Warrea and Warreopsis. Moreover, a niche shift in response to changing climate after the last glacial maximum is observed in Vargasiella, while no substantial changes in the occupied habitats were identified in the other related taxa. The clocktree of the Zygopetaleae estimated from the matK gene indicated that the most recent common ancestors of Vargasiella, Warrea and Warreopsis originated in the Miocene, while the divergence time for Vargasiella and Warrea was assessed at approximately 5.4 Ma ago. Vargasiella seems to be an outshoot of the main branch of evolution of the Zygopetaleae. It is noteworthy that the Vargasiella-Warrea dichotomy could have taken place later than the divergence of Warreopsis from the mutual lineage. The molecular analysis and morphological data suggest that Vargasiella and Warrea could have evolved from a common ancestor. Accumulation of morphological differences and acceleration of the evolution of Vargasiella were more intensive than in other Warreinae and this could probably be synchronized with adaptation to different climatic conditions.},

This study focuses on the Asian Spiranthes with an emphasis on understanding their biogeographic relationships and species delimitations using molecular markers. Our phylogenetic trees based on nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (trnL-trnLF, matK and trnS-G) sequences from samples across their range in Asia revealed the Asian Spiranthes are monophyletic. Ancestral area optimization suggested that North America forms the ancestral region for the Asian Spiranthes rather than Europe suggesting that they originated from a single long-distance dispersal event. Our study also revealed the presence of a cryptic species S. himalayensis, which was discovered based on molecular data thus emphasizing the importance of wide geographical sampling in phylogenetic studies. Sequences of cloned ITS provided support for the hypothesis that natural hybridization between S. sinensis and the newly described S. himalayensis resulted in the allotetraploid S. hongkongensis, with S. himalayensis as the paternal parent. One of the species complexes known in Asia is the S. sinensis complex, which shows a wide occurrence and is known for local geographical variants. Some of these variants have been described as new species in Australia and New Zealand. Our studies show that all the sampled variants including the Australian and New Zealand species show monophyly despite having long branches. This suggests that there may be high rates of gene flow between the geographically distinct forms resulting in lack of species resolution within the S. sinensis complex.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Lizard orchids of the genus Himantoglossum include many of Eurasia's most spectacular orchids, producing substantial spikes of showy flowers. However, until recently the genus had received only limited, and entirely traditional, systematic study. The aim of the current work was to provide a more robust molecular phylogeny in order to better understand the evolutionary relationships among species of particular conservation concern. METHODS All putative species of Himantoglossum s.l. were sampled across its geographical range. A large subsample of the 153 populations studied contributed to an initial survey of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) ribotypes. Smaller subsets were then sequenced for four plastid regions and the first intron of the low-copy-number nuclear gene LEAFY. Rooted using Steveniella as outgroup, phylogenetic trees were generated using parsimony and Bayesian methods from each of the three datasets, supplemented with a ribotype network. KEY RESULTS The resulting trees collectively determined the order of branching of the early divergent taxa as Himantoglossum comperianum {\textgreater} H. robertianum group {\textgreater} H. formosum, events that also involved significant morphological divergence. Relaxed molecular clock dating suggested that these divergences preceded the Pleistocene glaciations (the origin of the H. robertianum group may have coincided with the Messinian salinity crisis) and occurred in Asia Minor and/or the Caucasus. Among more controversial taxa of the H. hircinum-jankae clade, which are only subtly morphologically divergent, topological resolution was poorer and topological incongruence between datasets was consequently greater. CONCLUSIONS Plastid sequence divergence is broadly consistent with prior, morphologically circumscribed taxa and indicates a division between H. hircinum-adriaticum to the west of the Carpathians and H. jankae-caprinum (plus local endemics) to the east, a distinction also suggested by nrITS ribotypes. LEAFY phylogenies are less congruent with prior taxonomic arrangements and include one likely example of paralogy. Himantoglossum metlesicsianum fully merits its IUCN Endangered status. Potentially significant genetic variation was detected within Steveniella satyrioides, H. robertianum and H. hircinum. However, confident circumscription of the more derived species of Himantoglossum s.s., including local endemics of hybrid origin, must await future morphometric and population-genetic analyses.},

A combined analysis resulted in a better-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis of relationships among the major Ophrys lineages. Our data strongly support a division of Ophrys into two groups. These groups do not correspond to the earlier proposed sections Euophrys and Pseudophrys and are thus in conflict with traditional classifications. Our results support a well-resolved monophyletic group that contains the geographically widespread O. bombyliflora, O. speculum, O. tenthredinifera, and the O. fusca-lutea lineage. Relationships in the other group are poorly resolved.

	abstract = {Despite significant progress made in recent years toward developing an infrafamilial classification of Orchidaceae, our understanding of relationships among and within tribal and subtribal groups of epidendroid orchids remains incomplete. To reassess generic delimitation among one group of these epidendroids, the African angraecoids, phylogenetic relationships were inferred from DNA sequence data from three regions, ITS, matK, and the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, obtained from a broadly representative sample of taxa. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses yielded highly resolved trees that are in clear agreement and show significant support for many key clades within subtribe Angraecinae s.l. Angraecoid orchids comprise two well-supported clades: an African/American group and an Indian Ocean group. Molecular results also support many previously proposed relationships among genera, but also reveal some unexpected relationships. The genera Aerangis, Ancistrorhynchus, Bolusiella, Campylocentrum, Cyrtorchis, Dendrophylax, Eurychone, Microcoelia, Nephrangis, Podangis and Solenangis are all shown to be monophyletic, but Angraecopsis, Diaphananthe and Margelliantha are polyphyletic. Diaphananthe forms three well-supported clades, one of which might represent a new genus, and Rhipidoglossum is paraphyletic with respect to Cribbia and Rhaesteria, and also includes taxa currently assigned to Margelliantha. Tridactyle too is paraphyletic as Eggelingia is embedded within it. The large genus Angraecum is confirmed to be polyphyletic and several groups will have to be recognized as separate genera, including sections Dolabrifolia and Hadrangis. The recently segregated genus Pectinariella (previously recognized as A. sect. Pectinaria) is polyphyletic and its Continental African species will have to be removed. Similarly, some of the species recently transferred to Angraecoides that were previously placed in Angraecum sects. Afrangraecum and Conchoglossum will have to be moved and described as a new genus.},

Cranichideae are moderately supported as monophyletic, with Chloraeinae and Pterostylis-Megastylis indicated as their collective sisters. Within Cranichideae, Pachyplectroninae and Goodyerinae form a well-supported monophyletic group sister to a "core spiranthid" clade that includes, according to their branching order, Galeottiellinae, Manniellinae, and a Prescottiinae-Cranichidinae-Spiranthinae subclade. Inclusion of Galeottiella in Spiranthinae, as in previous classifications, renders the latter paraphyletic to all other spiranthid subtribes. Cranichidinae and Spiranthinae (minus Galeottiella) are monophyletic and strongly supported, but Prescottiinae form a grade that includes a strongly supported prescottioid Andean clade and a weakly supported Prescottia-Cranichidinae clade sister to Spiranthinae. Well-supported major clades in Spiranthinae identified in this study do not correspond to previous alliances or the narrowly defined subtribes in which they have been divided recently. Morphological characters, especially those that have been used for taxonomic delimitation in Cranichideae, are discussed against the framework of the molecular trees, emphasizing putative synapomorphies and problems derived from lack of information or inadequate interpretation of the characters.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Phylogenetic relationships of subtribes Cranichidinae and Prescottiinae, two diverse groups of neotropical terrestrial orchids, are not satisfactorily understood. A previous molecular phylogenetic study supported monophyly for Cranichidinae, but Prescottiinae consisted of two clades not sister to one another. However, that analysis included only 11 species and eight genera of these subtribes. Here, plastid and nuclear DNA sequences are analysed for an enlarged sample of genera and species of Cranichidinae and Prescottiinae with the aim of clarifying their relationships, evaluating the phylogenetic position of the monospecific genera Exalaria, Ocampoa and Pseudocranichis and examining the value of various structural traits as taxonomic markers. METHODS Approx. 6000 bp of nucleotide sequences from nuclear ribosomal (ITS) and plastid DNA (rbcL, matK-trnK and trnL-trnF) were analysed with cladistic parsimony and Bayesian inference for 45 species/14 genera of Cranichidinae and Prescottiinae (plus suitable outgroups). The utility of flower orientation, thickenings of velamen cell walls, hamular viscidium and pseudolabellum to mark clades recovered by the molecular analysis was assessed by tracing these characters on the molecular trees. KEY RESULTS Spiranthinae, Cranichidinae, paraphyletic Prescottia (with Pseudocranichis embedded), and a group of mainly Andean 'prescottioid' genera (the 'Stenoptera clade') were strongly supported. Relationships among these clades were unresolved by parsimony but the Bayesian tree provided moderately strong support for the resolution (Spiranthinae-(Stenoptera clade-(Prescottia/Pseudocranichis-Cranichidinae))). Three of the four structural characters mark clades on the molecular trees, but the possession of a pseudolabellum is variable in the polyphyletic Ponthieva. CONCLUSIONS No evidence was found for monophyly of Prescottiinae and the reinstatement of Cranichidinae s.l. (including the genera of 'Prescottiinae') is favoured. Cranichidinae s.l. are diagnosed by non-resupinate flowers. Lack of support from parsimony for relationships among the major clades of core spiranthids is suggestive of a rapid morphological radiation or a slow rate of molecular evolution.},

To investigate the origins of protandry and ESD in Catasetinae, we sequenced nuclear and chloroplast loci from 77 species, providing the most extensive data matrix of Catasetinae available so far with all major lineages represented. We used Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods to infer phylogenetic relationships and evolution of sexual systems. Irrespectively of the methods used, Catasetinae were monophyletic in molecular phylogenies, with all established generic lineages and their relationships resolved and highly supported. According to comparative reconstruction approaches, the last common ancestor of Catasetinae was inferred as having bisexual flowers (i.e., lacking protandry and ESD as well), and protandry originated once in core Catasetinae (comprising Catasetum, Clowesia, Cycnoches, Dressleria and Mormodes). In addition, three independent gains of ESD are reliably inferred, linked to corresponding loss of protandry within core Catasetinae. Thus, prior gain of protandry appears as the necessary prerequisite for gain of ESD in orchids. Our results contribute to a comprehensive evolutionary scenario for sexual systems in Catasetinae and more generally in orchids as well.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The orchid genus Dichaea, with over 100 species found throughout the neotropics, is easily recognized by distichous leaves on long stems without pseudobulbs and flowers with infrastigmatic ligules. The genus has previously been divided into four sections based primarily on presence of ovary bristles and a foliar abscission layer. The aim of this work is to use DNA sequence data to estimate phylogenetic relationships within Dichaea and map the distribution of major morphological characters that have been used to delimit subgenera/sections. METHODS Sequence data for the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers and plastid matK, trnL intron, trnL-F spacer and ycf1 for 67 ingroup and seven outgroup operational taxonomic units were used to estimate phylogenetic relationships within Dichaea. Taxa from each of the four sections were sampled, with the greatest representation from section Dichaea, the most diverse and taxonomically puzzling group. KEY RESULTS Molecular data and morphology support monophyly of Dichaea. Results indicate that section Dichaeopsis is polyphyletic and based on symplesiomorphies, including deciduous leaves and smooth ovaries that are widespread in Zygopetalinae. There are at least three well-supported clades within section Dichaeopsis. Section Pseudodichaea is monophyletic and defined by setose ovaries and leaves with an abscission layer. Sections Dichaea and Dichaeastrum are monophyletic and defined by pendent habit and persistent leaves. Section Dichaeastrum, distinguished from section Dichaea primarily by a glabrous ovary, is potentially polyphyletic. CONCLUSIONS The leaf abscission layer was lost once, occurring only in the derived sections Dichaea and Dichaeastrum. The setose fruit is a more homoplasious character with several losses and gains within the genus. We propose an informal division of the genus based upon five well-supported clades.},

	abstract = {The orchid family Orchidaceae is one of the largest angiosperm families, including many species of important economic value. While chloroplast genomes are very informative for systematics and species identification, there is very limited information available on chloroplast genomes in the Orchidaceae. Here, we report the complete chloroplast genomes of the medicinal plant Dendrobium officinale and the ornamental orchid Cypripedium macranthos, demonstrating their gene content and order and potential RNA editing sites. The chloroplast genomes of the above two species and five known photosynthetic orchids showed similarities in structure as well as gene order and content, but differences in the organization of the inverted repeat/small single-copy junction and ndh genes. The organization of the inverted repeat/small single-copy junctions in the chloroplast genomes of these orchids was classified into four types; we propose that inverted repeats flanking the small single-copy region underwent expansion or contraction among Orchidaceae. The AT-rich regions of the ycf1 gene in orchids could be linked to the recombination of inverted repeat/small single-copy junctions. Relative species in orchids displayed similar patterns of variation in ndh gene contents. Furthermore, fifteen highly divergent protein-coding genes were identified, which are useful for phylogenetic analyses in orchids. To test the efficiency of these genes serving as markers in phylogenetic analyses, coding regions of four genes (accD, ccsA, matK, and ycf1) were used as a case study to construct phylogenetic trees in the subfamily Epidendroideae. High support was obtained for placement of previously unlocated subtribes Collabiinae and Dendrobiinae in the subfamily Epidendroideae. Our findings expand understanding of the diversity of orchid chloroplast genomes and provide a reference for study of the molecular systematics of this family.},

Sequences of the nuclear ribosomal ITS, chloroplast trnL intron and combined DNA data sets were analysed to clarify the delimitation and the phylogeny of these groups. The morphological and palynological survey revealed a number of useful diagnostic characters which permit a clear definition of Ania, after the exclusion of a single taxonomically questionable species. Results confirmed that Ania is distinct from Tainia. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on molecular data provided the greatest resolution and produced a morphologically well differentiated clade of Ania.

	abstract = {In the present study, we formally describe Liparis pingxiangensis as a new species from Guangxi, China on the basis of morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses. It is easily distinguished from closely related species by strongly curved column without column wings, and broadly rhombic-elliptic lip with 2 uncinate calli at the base. In particular, it differs most markedly from its congeners in possessing two pollinia attached by long and prominent caudicles (not stipes), to a distinct sticky disc. This type of pollinarium, as far as we know, is not found in any other species of Liparis, and is also unique among the orchids with waxy pollinia. We then proceeded to a phylogenetic analysis to ascertain the systematic position of this enigmatic species. Molecular study based on nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid matK DNA sequence data supports L. pingxiangensis as a distinct species, which forms an independent lineage sister to L. nervosa and its allies (93\% BS, 1.00 BPP). In the light of previous work, the findings have important implications for a better understanding of the well-supported pattern mainly based on vegetative features in Malaxideae.},

The genus Cypripedium was confirmed as monophyletic. Our data provided strong support for monophyletic grouping of eight infrageneric sections (Subtropica, Obtusipetala, Trigonopedia, Sinopedilum, Bifolia, Flabelinervia, Arietinum, and Cypripedium) defined in earlier taxonomic treatments, and paraphyletic grouping of two sections (Irapeana and Retinervi). Within the genus Cypripedium, the first divergent lineage consisted of two Mesomaerican species, and subsequently the Cypripedium debile lineage from eastern Asia was split. Our study did not support the notion that two Asian species (Cypripedium subtropicum and Cypripedium singchii) were closely related to either Mesoamerican Cypripedium irapeanum or North American Cypripedium californicum, as indicated by previous interpretations based on morphological evidences. In addition, one pair of vicariant species, Cypripedium plectrochilum (eastern Asia) and Cypripedium arietinum (North America), unique to section Arietinum, was confirmed. Furthermore, within the monophyletic section Cypripedium two previously recognized subsections, Cypripedium and Macrantha, were shown to be paraphyletic. Our results suggested that this section split into two groups based on distribution (North America vs. Eurasia) instead of such previously used, morphological traits as flower color, and the shape of the lips (labellum) and lateral petals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Species' boundaries applied within Christensonella have varied due to the continuous pattern of variation and mosaic distribution of diagnostic characters. The main goals of this study were to revise the species' delimitation and propose a more stable classification for this genus. In order to achieve these aims phylogenetic relationships were inferred using DNA sequence data and cytological diversity within Christensonella was examined based on chromosome counts and heterochromatin patterns. The results presented describe sets of diagnostic morphological characters that can be used for species' identification. METHODS Phylogenetic studies were based on sequence data of nuclear and plastid regions, analysed using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood criteria. Cytogenetic observations of mitotic cells were conducted using CMA and DAPI fluorochromes. KEY RESULTS Six of 21 currently accepted species were recovered. The results also support recognition of the 'C. pumila' clade as a single species. Molecular phylogenetic relationships within the 'C. acicularis-C. madida' and 'C. ferdinandiana-C. neowiedii' species' complexes were not resolved and require further study. Deeper relationships were incongruent between plastid and nuclear trees, but with no strong bootstrap support for either, except for the position of C. vernicosa. Cytogenetic data indicated chromosome numbers of 2n = 36, 38 and 76, and with substantial variation in the presence and location of CMA/DAPI heterochromatin bands. CONCLUSIONS The recognition of ten species of Christensonella is proposed according to the molecular and cytogenetic patterns observed. In addition, diagnostic morphological characters are presented for each recognized species. Banding patterns and chromosome counts suggest the occurrence of centric fusion/fission events, especially for C. ferdinandiana. The results suggest that 2n = 36 karyotypes evolved from 2n = 38 through descendent dysploidy. Patterns of heterochromatin distribution and other karyotypic data proved to be a valuable source of information to understand evolutionary patterns within Maxillariinae orchids.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships of the orchid genus Aerides (Epidendroideae, Vandeae, Aeridinae) from Southeast Asia were inferred from DNA sequences of one nuclear (nrITS) and two plastid (matK, trnL-trnL-F) regions of 48 taxa (21 Aerides, 25 other Aeridinae, 2 outgroup). Analyses of the combined datasets with parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods revealed that Aerides is monophyletic and consists of three well-supported subclades which are only partly in accordance with previous sectional delimitations based on floral characters. The two different flower types in Aerides (hidden versus open spur entrance) seem to have evolved at least twice in geographically distinct areas. The phylogeny presented here is yet another example in Orchidaceae where floral morphology cannot be relied on to reconstruct phylogenetic history but rather is the result of pollinator-driven selection. The Aerides subclades are characterized by three different length classes of the mutation-rich P8 region in the trnL intron. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the P8 region was studied in orchids. The matK gene has been assumed to be a pseudogene in orchids due to occasional occurrence of frameshift indels, low transition/transversion (ts:tv) ratios and low substitution rates at the 3rd codon position. However, matK does not appear to be a pseudogene in Aerides and a comparison with data from other angiosperms suggests that ts:tv ratios and low substitution rates have been overestimated as arguments for a pseudogene status of matK in orchids.},

Based on three DNA markers (plastid matK, rbcL, and nuclear ITS), morphological characters, and a broad sampling of Orchidinae and selected Habenariinae mainly from Asia (a total of 153 accessions of 145 species in 31 genera), generic delimitation and phylogenetic relationships within the subtribe Orchidinae and Habenariinae from Asia were assessed. Orchidinae and Asian Habenariinae are monophyletic, and Orchidinae is divided into distinct superclades. Many genera, such as Amitostigma, Habenaria, Hemipilia, Herminium, Platanthera, Peristylus and Ponerorchis, are not monophyletic. Habenaria is subdivided into two distantly related groups, while Platanthera is subdivided into three even more disparate groups. Many previously undetected phylogenetic relationships, such as clades formed by the Amitostigma-Neottianthe-Ponerorchis complex, Platanthera latilabris group, Ponerorchis chrysea, Sirindhornia, and Tsaiorchis, are well supported by both molecular and morphological evidence. We propose to combine Hemipiliopsis with Hemipilia, Amitostigma and Neottianthe with Ponerorchis, Smithorchis with Platanthera, and Aceratorchis and Neolindleya with Galearis, and to establish a new genus to accommodate Ponerorchis chrysea. Tsaiorchis and Sirindhornia are two distinctive genera supported by both molecular data and morphological characters. A new genus, Hsenhsua, and 41 new combinations are proposed based on these findings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Tribe Orchideae (Orchidaceae: Orchidoideae) comprises around 62 mostly terrestrial genera, which are well represented in the Northern Temperate Zone and less frequently in tropical areas of both the Old and New Worlds. Phylogenetic relationships within this tribe have been studied previously using only nuclear ribosomal DNA (nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer, nrITS). However, different parts of the phylogenetic tree in these analyses were weakly supported, and integrating information from different plant genomes is clearly necessary in orchids, where reticulate evolution events are putatively common. The aims of this study were to: (1) obtain a well-supported and dated phylogenetic hypothesis for tribe Orchideae, (ii) assess appropriateness of recent nomenclatural changes in this tribe in the last decade, (3) detect possible examples of reticulate evolution and (4) analyse in a temporal context evolutionary trends for subtribe Orchidinae with special emphasis on pollination systems. METHODS The analyses included 118 samples, belonging to 103 species and 25 genera, for three DNA regions (nrITS, mitochondrial cox1 intron and plastid rpl16 intron). Bayesian and maximum-parsimony methods were used to construct a well-supported and dated tree. Evolutionary trends in the subtribe were analysed using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods of character evolution. KEY RESULTS The dated phylogenetic tree strongly supported the recently recircumscribed generic concepts of Bateman and collaborators. Moreover, it was found that Orchidinae have diversified in the Mediterranean basin during the last 15 million years, and one potential example of reticulate evolution in the subtribe was identified. In Orchidinae, pollination systems have shifted on numerous occasions during the last 23 million years. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that ancestral Orchidinae were hymenopteran-pollinated, food-deceptive plants and that these traits have been dominant throughout the evolutionary history of the subtribe in the Mediterranean. Evidence was also obtained that the onset of sexual deception might be linked to an increase in labellum size, and the possibility is discussed that diversification in Orchidinae developed in parallel with diversification of bees and wasps from the Miocene onwards.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The issue of determining the most appropriate rank for each accepted taxon fuels ongoing controversy throughout systematics. The particularly marked escalation of such issues in modern Australian orchid systematics merits examination, not only because of wider implications in taxonomy but also because of direct effects on studies of comparative biology and conservation management. SCOPE This paper briefly reviews the causes of recent taxonomic turmoil for Australian orchids and outlines new research opportunities and conservation implications arising from an improved understanding of their molecular phylogenetics. CONCLUSIONS DNA sequencing and intensified field work have contributed towards a much improved understanding of Australian orchid systematics. Great progress has been made in discerning monophyletic groups or clades. Fresh interpretations of morphological evolution have been made possible by comparisons with the results of DNA analyses. Significant conceptual shifts from polymorphic species concepts to biological and phylogenetic concepts have also elevated the discovery and description of new species. Consequently, over the past decade, the number of Australian orchid species recognized by taxonomists has risen from approx. 900 to 1200. Similarly, the number of genera recognized by some taxonomists has increased from 110 to 192, resulting in 45\% of Australian species/subspecies being assigned a new generic epithet since 2000. At higher taxonomic levels, much of the recent controversy in Australian orchid systematics reflects a divergence in views about where to split and assign formal names within unequivocally monophyletic groups. Differences regarding typification in the case of Caladenia have added additional confusion and complexity. However, new insights into and research opportunities concerning speciation processes in orchids have arisen from the wealth of new data and discrimination of species. Robustly supported molecular analyses of most clades enable comparative biological studies of Australian orchids to be conducted as never before. Outstanding subjects exist for exploring pollination by sexual deception and understanding the intricacies of mycorrhizal relationships and orchid conservation biology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The temporal origin and diversification of orchids (family Orchidaceae) has been subject to intense debate in the last decade. The description of the first reliable fossil in 2007 enabled a direct calibration of the orchid phylogeny, but little attention has been paid to the potential influence of dating methodology in obtaining reliable age estimates. Moreover, two new orchid fossils described in 2009 have not yet been incorporated in a molecular dating analysis. Here we compare the ages of major orchid clades estimated under two widely used methods, a Bayesian relaxed clock implemented in BEAST and Penalized Likelihood implemented in r8s. We then perform a new family-level analysis by integrating all 3 available fossils and using BEAST. To evaluate how the newly estimated ages may influence the evolutionary interpretation of a species-level phylogeny, we assess divergence times for the South American genus Hoffmannseggella (subfam. Epidendroideae), for which we present an almost complete phylogeny (40 out of 41 species sampled). RESULTS Our results provide additional support that all extant orchids shared a most recent common ancestor in the Late Cretaceous (approximately 77 million years ago, Ma). However, we estimate the crown age of the five orchid subfamilies to be generally (approximately1-8 Ma) younger than previously calculated under the Penalized Likelihood algorithm and using a single internal fossil calibration. The crown age of Hoffmannseggella is estimated here at approximately 11 Ma, some 3 Ma more recently than estimated under Penalized Likelihood. CONCLUSIONS Contrary to recent suggestions that orchid diversification began in a period of global warming, our results place the onset of diversification of the largest orchid subfamilies (Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae) in a period of global cooling subsequent to the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. The diversification of Hoffmannseggella appears even more correlated to late Tertiary climatic fluctuations than previously suggested. With the incorporation of new fossils in the orchid phylogeny and the use of a method that is arguably more adequate given the present data, our results represent the most up-to-date estimate of divergence times in orchids.},

Using nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA sequences, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), chloroplast DNA restriction fragments, and chromosome counts, we present a phylogenetic and taxonomic study of the genus. Calopogon multiflorus and C. pallidus are consistently sister species, but the relationships of C. barbatus, C. oklahomensis, and C. tuberosus are not as clear. In the ITS analysis C. oklahomensis is sister to C. barbatus, whereas it is sister to C. tuberosus in the plastid restriction fragment analysis. Furthermore, all species were found to have chromosome numbers of 2n = 38 and 40, with the exception of the putatively hybrid-derived C. oklahomensis with 2n = 114 and 120. The hexaploidy of the latter, plus the discrepancy in its position between the ITS and plastid restriction fragment trees, could suggest that it is of hybrid origin. However, the presence of unique morphological and molecular characters might indicate that it is either an ancient hybrid or not of hybrid derivation at all. Finally, using these molecular methods all taxa appear to generally be discrete groups, with the exception of C. tuberosus vars. latifolius and tuberosus, the former of which is best combined with the latter.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Species or clades may retain or shift their environmental niche space over evolutionary time. Understanding these processes offers insights into the environmental processes fuelling lineage diversification and might also provide information on past range dynamics of ecosystems. However, little is known about the relative contributions of niche conservatism versus niche divergence to species diversification in the tropics. Here, we examined broad-scale patterns of niche evolution within a Pliocene-Pleistocene clade of epiphytic Bulbophyllum orchids (30 spp.) whose collective distribution covers the northwest and eastern forest ecosystems of Madagascar. RESULTS Using species occurrence data, ecological niche models, and multivariate analyses of contributing variables, we identified a three-state niche distribution character for the entire clade, coinciding with three major forest biomes viz. phytogeographical provinces in Madagascar: A, Northwest 'Sambirano'; B, 'Eastern Lowlands'; and C, 'Central Highlands'. A time-calibrated phylogeny and Bayesian models of niche evolution were then used to detect general trends in the direction of niche change over the clade's history (≤5.3 Ma). We found highest transitions rates between lowlands (A and B) and (mostly from B) into the highland (C), with extremely low rates out of the latter. Lowland-to-highland transitions occurred frequently during the Quaternary, suggesting that climate-induced vegetational shifts promoted niche transitions and ecological speciation at this time. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal that niche transitions occurred frequently and asymmetrically within this Madagascan orchid clade, and in particular over Quaternary time scales. Intrinsic features germane to Bulbophyllum (e.g., high dispersal ability, drought tolerance, multiple photosynthetic pathways) as well as extrinsic factors (ecological, historical) likely interacted to generate the niche transition patterns observed. In sum, our results support the emerging idea of dramatic environmental and climatic fluctuations in Madagascar during the recent geological past, which overturns the long-held paradigm of long-term stability in tropical forest settings. The generality of the patterns and timings reported here awaits the availability of additional comparative studies in other Madagascan endemics.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12862-015-0471-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND The transition from outcrossing to selfing has long been portrayed as an 'evolutionary dead end' because, first, reversals are unlikely and, second, selfing lineages suffer from higher rates of extinction owing to a reduced potential for adaptation and the accumulation of deleterious mutations. We tested these two predictions in a clade of Madagascan Bulbophyllum orchids (30 spp.), including eight species where auto-pollinating morphs (i.e., selfers, without a 'rostellum') co-exist with their pollinator-dependent conspecifics (i.e., outcrossers, possessing a rostellum). Specifically, we addressed this issue on the basis of a time-calibrated phylogeny by means of ancestral character reconstructions and within the state-dependent evolution framework of BiSSE (Binary State Speciation and Extinction), which allowed jointly estimating rates of transition, speciation, and extinction between outcrossing and selfing. RESULTS The eight species capable of selfing occurred in scattered positions across the phylogeny, with two likely originating in the Pliocene (ca. 4.4-3.1 Ma), one in the Early Pleistocene (ca. 2.4 Ma), and five since the mid-Pleistocene (ca. ≤ 1.3 Ma). We infer that this scattered phylogenetic distribution of selfing is best described by models including up to eight independent outcrossing-to-selfing transitions and very low rates of speciation (and either moderate or zero rates of extinction) associated with selfing. CONCLUSIONS The frequent and irreversible outcrossing-to-selfing transitions in Madagascan Bulbophyllum are clearly congruent with the first prediction of the dead end hypothesis. The inability of our study to conclusively reject or support the likewise predicted higher extinction rate in selfing lineages might be explained by a combination of methodological limitations (low statistical power of our BiSSE approach to reliably estimate extinction in small-sized trees) and evolutionary processes (insufficient time elapsed for selfers to go extinct). We suggest that, in these tropical orchids, a simple genetic basis of selfing (via loss of the 'rostellum') is needed to explain the strikingly recurrent transitions to selfing, perhaps reflecting rapid response to parallel and novel selective environments over Late Quaternary (≤ 1.3 Ma) time scales.},

Support for many tribal-level groups within Epidendroideae is evident, but relationships among these groups remain uncertain, probably due to a rapid radiation in the subfamily that resulted in short branches along the spine of the tree. A series of experiments examined jackknife parameters and strategies to determine a reasonable balance between computational effort and results. We found that support values plateau rapidly with increased search effort. Tree bisection-reconnection swapping in a single search replicate per jackknife replicate and saving only two trees resulted in values that were close to those obtained in the most extensive searches. Although this approach uses considerably more computational effort than less extensive (or no) swapping, the results were also distinctly better. The effect of saving a maximal number of trees in each jackknife replicate can also be pronounced and is important for representing support accurately.},

	abstract = {Corallorhizinae are a small group of Old and New World temperate orchids of which a core monophyletic group comprises Govenia, Cremastra, Aplectrum, Oreorchis and the leafless Corallorhiza, and which according to phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ITS and plastid matK sequences, are related in this way: (Govenia (Cremastra (Aplectrum (Oreorchis (Corallorhiza))))). This hypothesis is consistent with the progressive deletion of the trnK intron and matK ORF. Frameshift-resulting indels yield a predicted loss of translation for the critical "domain X" region of matK and are evidence that matK is a probable pseudogene in Aplectrum, Oreorchis, and Corallorhiza. Within Corallorhiza, a previous hypothesis based on plastid DNA restriction site analysis is confirmed, with the thickened-labellum C. striata group being sister to the thin-labellum remainder of the genus, within which the circumboreal C. trifida is sister to the remainder, which then comprise two further sister groups: C. maculata + C. bulbosa + C. mertensiana and C. odontorhiza + C. wisteriana. A close relationship between C. striata and the recently described Appalachian C. bentleyi is shown; in particular, C. bentleyi is more closely allied to a southern Mexican population of C. striata than it is to northern North American C. striata populations, suggesting that two lineages, each with Mexican and northern North American populations, exist within the C. striata group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The largest subfamily of orchids, Epidendroideae, represents one of the most significant diversifications among flowering plants in terms of pollination strategy, vegetative adaptation and number of species. Although many groups in the subfamily have been resolved, significant relationships in the tree remain unclear, limiting conclusions about diversification and creating uncertainty in the classification. This study brings together DNA sequences from nuclear, plastid and mitochrondrial genomes in order to clarify relationships, to test associations of key characters with diversification and to improve the classification. METHODS Sequences from seven loci were concatenated in a supermatrix analysis for 312 genera representing most of epidendroid diversity. Maximum-likelihood and parsimony analyses were performed on this matrix and on subsets of the data to generate trees and to investigate the effect of missing values. Statistical character-associated diversification analyses were performed. KEY RESULTS Likelihood and parsimony analyses yielded highly resolved trees that are in strong agreement and show significant support for many key clades. Many previously proposed relationships among tribes and subtribes are supported, and some new relationships are revealed. Analyses of subsets of the data suggest that the relatively high number of missing data for the full analysis is not problematic. Diversification analyses show that epiphytism is most strongly associated with diversification among epidendroids, followed by expansion into the New World and anther characters that are involved with pollinator specificity, namely early anther inflexion, cellular pollinium stalks and the superposed pollinium arrangement. CONCLUSIONS All tested characters show significant association with speciation in Epidendroideae, suggesting that no single character accounts for the success of this group. Rather, it appears that a succession of key features appeared that have contributed to diversification, sometimes in parallel.},

Despite its evolutionary and ecological significance, resupination has rarely been studied in a phylogenetic context. Ten types of resupination occur among the 210 species of the orchid genus Bulbophyllum on Madagascar. We investigated the evolution of resupination in a representative sample of these species by first reconstructing a combined nrITS and cpDNA phylogeny for a sectional reclassification and then plotting the different types of inflorescence development, which correlated well with main clades. Resupination by apical drooping of the rachis appears to have evolved from apical drooping of the peduncle. Erect inflorescences with resupinate flowers seem to have evolved several times into either erect inflorescences with (partly) non-resupinate flowers or pendulous inflorescences with resupinate flowers.},

A maximum likelihood tree based on combined ETS and ITS sequences suggests that the Western European Dactylorhiza allotetraploids have evolved by hybridization between four main diploid lineages. Cloned sequences and the topology of the ITS plus ETS tree indicate that the allotetraploid species D. elata, D. brennensis, and D. sphagnicola have originated from the autotetraploid D. maculata together with the diploid D. incarnata, while D. majalis, D. traunsteineri, and D. angustata seem to have evolved by hybridization between the D. fuchsii s.str and D. incarnata lineages. Finally, the diploid D. saccifera lineage seems to have been involved together with the D. incarnata lineage in the formation of the allotetraploid D. praetermissa. The observed congruence between the chloroplast tree and the ITS/ETS tree suggests a directional evolution of the nrDNA after polyploidization in favor of the maternal genome. Considered together with morphological, biogeographical, and ecological evidence, the molecular analysis leads us to recognize four species within the investigated allotetraploid complex, namely D. majalis, D. praetermissa, D. elata, and D. sphagnicola.},

The aim of this study is to produce this framework as a basis for more rigorous species delimitation and conservation recommendations. METHODS Nuclear and plastid DNA sequencing and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) were performed on 85 accessions of Ophrys, spanning the full range of species aggregates currently recognized. Data were analysed using a combination of parsimony and Bayesian tree-building techniques and by principal co-ordinates analysis. KEY RESULTS Complementary phylogenetic analyses and ordinations using nuclear, plastid and AFLP datasets identify ten genetically distinct groups (six robust) within the genus that may in turn be grouped into three sections (treated as subgenera by some authors). Additionally, genetic evidence is provided for a close relationship between the O. tenthredinifera, O. bombyliflora and O. speculum groups. The combination of these analytical techniques provides new insights into Ophrys systematics, notably recognition of the novel O. umbilicata group. CONCLUSIONS Heterogeneous copies of the nuclear ITS region show that some putative Ophrys species arose through hybridization rather than divergent speciation. The supposedly highly specific pseudocopulatory pollination syndrome of Ophrys is demonstrably 'leaky', suggesting that the genus has been substantially over-divided at the species level.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The classification of the primarily Australasian group of orchids Caladenia and allied genera (Caladeniinae: Diurideae) containing 71 federally listed threatened species has proven controversial. Analyzing these species using genetic material will provide a sound basis for their classification and the capacity to ensure accurate conservation measures can be implemented. METHODS We present a multigene analysis based on nuclear ribosomal ITS and five plastid regions from 54 species representing all major taxonomic groups within Caladeniinae. KEY RESULTS In our combined analysis, apart from Leptoceras and Praecoxanthus, all Caladenia ingroup taxa form a strongly supported clade that is also supported by morphological synapomorphies (parallel leaf venation; leaf solitary, lanceolate, covered with glandular or eglandular trichomes). Characters and character states historically used to delimit taxa were revealed to be homoplasious and therefore do not support recognition of Arachnorchis, Cyanicula, Drakonorchis, Ericksonella, Jonesiopsis, Petalochilus, Pheladenia, and Stegostyla as previously proposed. Glossodia and Elythranthera are shown to be a specialist group embedded within Caladenia. CONCLUSIONS Based on our results, none of the current systems of classification of the subtribe is satisfactory. Instead our results point to Lindley's 1840 interpretation of Caladenia, but including Glossodia and Elythranthera, as being the most accurate reflection of the group. Accordingly, a renewed reclassification of Caladeniinae is proposed as well as several new combinations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Most molecular phylogenetic studies of Orchidaceae have relied heavily on DNA sequences from the plastid genome. Nuclear and mitochondrial loci have only been superficially examined for their systematic value. Since 40\% of the genera within Vanilloideae are achlorophyllous mycoheterotrophs, this is an ideal group of orchids in which to evaluate non-plastid gene sequences. METHODS Phylogenetic reconstructions for Vanilloideae were produced using independent and combined data from the nuclear 18S, 5.8S and 26S rDNA genes and the mitochondrial atpA gene and nad1b-c intron. KEY RESULTS These new data indicate placements for genera such as Lecanorchis and Galeola, for which plastid gene sequences have been mostly unavailable. Nuclear and mitochondrial parsimony jackknife trees are congruent with each other and previously published trees based solely on plastid data. Because of high rates of sequence divergence among vanilloid orchids, even the short 5.8S rDNA gene provides impressive levels of resolution and support. CONCLUSIONS Orchid systematists are encouraged to sequence nuclear and mitochondrial gene regions along with the growing number of plastid loci available.},

	abstract = {Nuclear ITS and plastid matK sequences were collected for 71 taxa of Malaxideae (Orchidaceae). Resulting cladograms are highly resolved and well supported by jackknife analyses. These indicate that the traditional classification system of the tribe using characters primarily related to floral morphology does not reflect the evolutionary history of these taxa. Rather, the tribe is split into two major clades: one of terrestrial species and another of epiphytes. Within the epiphytic clade, taxa with laterally compressed leaves (Oberonia) are monophyletic, whereas the remaining taxa (Liparis pro parte) have elongate conduplicate leaves and form a paraphyletic grade of at least two additional monophyletic lineages. Within the terrestrial clade, taxa with plicate leaves (Liparis p.p. and Malaxis p.p.) clearly separate from taxa with conduplicate leaves (Liparis p.p. and Malaxis p.p.). Although further taxon sampling should take place before nomenclature is changed, it seems evident that Malaxideae will need to be divided into at least seven genera. Furthermore, the transition from epiphytic to terrestrial habit is documented to have occurred only once in Malaxideae, and the value of vegetative over reproductive features in classifying some groups of orchids is again demonstrated.},

The psaB tree topology is similar to the rbcL tree, although the psaB data contain less homoplasy and provide greater bootstrap support than rbcL alone. In combination, the two-gene tree recovers the five monophyletic subfamilial clades currently recognized in Orchidaceae, but fails to resolve the positions of Cypripedioideae and Vanilloideae. These new topologies help to clarify some of the anomalous results recovered when rbcL is analyzed alone. Both genes appear to be absent from the plastid genome of several achlorophyllous orchids, but are present in the form of presumably non-functional pseudogenes in Cyrtosia. This study is the first to document the utility of psaB sequences for phylogenetic studies of plants below the family level.},

The combined data matrix contained 4094 characters and was analysed using parsimony and Bayesian inference. Our results show that the generic status of Schizodium can no longer be supported, as it is deeply embedded within the genus Disa. Furthermore, the currently recognised subgenera do not reflect the phylogenetic relationships and should be rejected. Several of the currently recognised sections are monophyletic, others contain misplaced elements, while some are polyphyletic. Morphological divergence, rather than convergence, has hampered previous attempts at a phylogenetic classification of the Disinae. On the basis of our molecular phylogenetic hypothesis, we propose a monotypic subtribe Disinae and a subdivision of the genus Disa into 18 sections.},

Here we investigated the radiation of sexually deceptive bee orchids (Ophrys). Based on a time-calibrated phylogeny and by means of ancestral character reconstruction and divergence time estimation, we estimated the tempo and mode of this radiation within a state-dependent evolutionary framework. It appears that, in the Pleistocene, the evolution of Ophrys was marked by episodes of rapid diversification coinciding with shifts to different pollinator types: from wasps to Eucera bees to Andrena and other bees. An abrupt increase in net diversification rate was detected in three clades. Among these, two phylogenetically distant lineages switched from Eucera to Andrena and other bees in a parallel fashion and at about the same time in their evolutionary history. Lack of early radiation associated with the evolution of the key innovation of sexual deception suggests that Ophrys diversification was mainly driven by subsequent ecological opportunities provided by the exploitation of novel pollinator groups, encompassing many bee species slightly differing in their sex pheromone communication systems, and by spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pollinator mosaic.},

Bayesian methods provided a fairly well supported reconstruction of the phylogeny of the Vanilloideae sub-family and more particularly of the genus Vanilla. Three major phylogenetic groups in the genus Vanilla were differentiated, which is in disagreement with the actual classification in two sections (Foliosae and Aphyllae) based on morphological traits. Recent Bayesian relaxed molecular clock methods allowed to test the two main hypotheses of the phylogeography of the genus Vanilla. Early radiation of the Vanilla genus and diversification by vicariance consecutive to the break-up of Gondwana, 95 million years ago (Mya), was incompatible with the admitted age of origin of Angiosperm. Based on the Vanilloideae age recently estimated to 71 million years ago (Mya), we conclude that the genus Vanilla would have appeared approximately 34 Mya in South America, when continents were already separated. Nevertheless, whatever the two extreme scenarios tested, at least three long distance migration events are needed to explain the present distribution of Vanilla species in tropical areas. These transoceanic dispersions could have occurred via transoceanic passageway such as the Rio Grande Ridge and the involvement of floating vegetation mats and migratory birds.},

This study has led to a new interpretation of the evolutionary relationships in this genus. The well-defined phylogenetic tree supports a division of taxa into two main clades, each including two minor groups. The molecular relationships found in this study differ from those defined by traditional systematic morphological assessments. By comparing the variation in sequence to variations in floral traits, we propose that the split in the two main lineages reflects an early differentiation of flower size, perhaps due to the shift from allo- to self-pollination. Conversely, the relationships within each minor group do not reflect floral size variation; therefore, we presume that this diversification resulted from genetic drift, local selection forces, and multiple, independent transitions towards self-pollination and polyploidy.},

	abstract = {Habenaria is a large genus of terrestrial orchids distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The integrity and monophyly of this genus have been under discussion for many years, and at one time or another, several genera have been either included in a broadly defined Habenaria or segregated from it. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships of the Neotropical members of the genus and selected groups of African Habenaria were investigated using DNA sequences from the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the plastid matK gene sampled from 151 taxa of Habenaria from the Neotropics (ca. 51\% of the total) as well as 20 species of Habenaria and Bonatea from the Old World. Bayesian and parsimony trees were congruent with each other, and in all analyses, the Neotropical species formed a highly supported group. African species of Habenaria in sections Dolichostachyae, Podandria, Diphyllae, Ceratopetalae and Bilabrellae, and the Neotropical clade formed a highly supported "core Habenaria clade", which includes the type species of the genus from the New World. The topology of the trees indicates an African origin for the Neotropical clade and the low sequence divergence among the Neotropical species suggests a recent radiation of the genus in the New World. Species of Bonatea and Habenaria sections Chlorinae and Multipartitae formed a well-supported clade that was sister to the "core Habenaria clade". The Neotropical clade consists of at least 21 well-supported subgroups, but all Neotropical sections of the current sectional classification are paraphyletic or polyphyletic and will need extensive revision and recircumscription. Most of the Neotropical subgroups formed morphologically uniform assemblage of species, but some cases of morphological divergence within subgroups and convergence between subgroups indicated that morphology alone can be misleading for inferring relationships within the genus. The genera Bertauxia, Kusibabella and Habenella, segregated from New World Habenaria, are not monophyletic and a revision of the sectional classification rather than a generic division seems most appropriate. Our results do not support an extensive generic fragmentation of Habenaria as previously suggested and will provide a framework for revising the infrageneric classification and investigating the patterns of morphological evolution and geographical distribution of the genus in the New World.},

Plastid DNA (orchids) and ITS (fungi) were sequenced for 107 individuals from 42 populations across North America to identify C. striata mycobionts and test hypotheses on fungal host specificity. Four largely allopatric orchid plastid clades were recovered, and all fungal sequences were most similar to ectomycorrhizal Tomentella (Thelephoraceae), nearly all to T. fuscocinerea. Orchid-fungal gene trees were incongruent but nonindependent; orchid clades associated with divergent sets of fungi, with a clade of Californian orchids subspecialized toward a narrow Tomentella fuscocinerea clade. Both geography and orchid clades were important determinants of fungal association, following a geographic mosaic model of specificity on Tomentella fungi.

Phylogenetic analysis of rbcL+ITS gave high jackknife support for relationships among species. We found evidence of pseudogene formation in all lineages of the Corallorhiza striata complex and in some lineages of the C. maculata complex. Evidence includes: stop codons, frameshifts, decreased d(S)/d(N) ratios, replacements not observed in photosynthetic species, rate heterogeneity, and high likelihood of neutral evolution.

	abstract = {Angraecum is the largest genus of subtribe Angraecinae (Orchidaceae) with about 221 species. Madagascar is the center of the diversity for the genus with ca. 142 species, of which 90\% are endemic. The great morphological diversity associated with species diversification in the genus on the island of Madagascar offers valuable insights for macroevolutionary studies. Phylogenies of the Angraecinae have been published but a lack of taxon and character sampling and their limited taxonomic resolution limit their uses for macroevolutionary studies. We present a new phylogeny of Angraecum based on chloroplast sequence data (matk, rps16, trnL), nuclear ribosomal (ITS2) and 39 morphological characters from 194 Angraecinae species of which 69 were newly sampled. Using this phylogeny, we evaluated the monophyly of the sections of Angraecum as defined by Garay and investigated the patterns of species diversification within the genus. We used maximum parsimony and bayesian analyses to generate phylogenetic trees and dated divergence times of the phylogeny. We analyzed diversification patterns within Angraecinae and Angraecum with an emphasis on four floral characters (flower color, flower size, labellum position, spur length) using macroevolutionary models to evaluate which characters or character states are associated with speciation rates, and inferred ancestral states of these characters. The phylogenetic analysis showed the polyphyly of Angraecum sensu lato and of all Angraecum sections except sect. Hadrangis, and that morphology can be consistent with the phylogeny. It appeared that the characters (flower color, flower size, spur length) formerly used by many authors to delineate Angraecum groups were insufficient to do so. However, the newly described character, position of the labellum (uppermost and lowermost), was the main character delimiting clades within a monophyletic Angraecum sensu stricto. This character also appeared to be associated with speciation rates in Angraecum. The macroevolutionary model-based phylogeny failed to detect shifts in diversification that could be associated directly with morphological diversification. Diversification in Angraecum resulted from gradual species accumulation through time rather than from rapid radiation, a diversification pattern often encountered in tropical rain forests.},

They are currently included within an expanded concept of Cranichidinae in the tribe Cranichideae, but DNA sequence data show that neither Prescottiinae s.l. nor Cranichidinae s.s. are monophyletic. Prescottiinae s.l. consist of two strongly supported lineages: the Altensteinia and Prescottia clades, which have closer affinities to Spiranthinae than to Cranichidinae. The Prescottia clade comprises two well-supported subclades, one including most sampled species of Prescottia and a second one with Pseudocranichis thysanochila sister to Prescottia tubulosa. As a group, they are sister to Spiranthinae. Sister to this pair is the Altensteinia clade comprised of six genera, whose intergeneric relationships are well resolved. Finally, Cranichidinae s.s. is sister to all three of these clades. Morphological and ecological features distinguishing the major groups are discussed, as are potential synapomorphies to define them. The reconstructed phylogeny indicates that the classification of Cranichideae needs to be reexamined.},

Sequences were subjected to various alignments by changing the gap opening and extension parameters. After a preliminary parsimony analysis, the alignment with the lowest homoplasy indicators was chosen as optimal. The phylogenetic analysis, carried out on the optimal alignment by using Gennaria as an outgroup and a total of 31 taxa, showed that all the genera considered in this study are nested in Orchis despite their distinct morphological features. Genus Orchis is divided into two major clades, each of which includes one or more of the other genera in this study. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis does not match previous conclusions based on vegetative and floral morphology of the taxa involved but is congruent with isoenzyme, karyological, and chloroplast DNA restriction data. Our results indicate that floral morphology is highly flexible and current generic and infrageneric limits are artificial. Even if some floral characters closely correspond to the molecular data, most are highly homoplastic and thus unsuitable for phylogenetic reconstruction. Various traits pertaining to floral morphology may be interpreted as a result of ecological convergence related to pollinator-mediated selection; such characters can undergo drastic modifications without correspondingly dramatic genetic changes.},

In lycophytes and monilophytes (leptosporangiate ferns, eusporangiate ferns, Psilotaceae, and Equisetaceae), on the other hand, relatively few noncoding chloroplast DNA regions have been explored. We screened 30 lycophyte and monilophyte species to determine the potential utility of PCR amplification primers for 18 noncoding chloroplast DNA regions that have previously been used in seed plant studies. Of these primer sets eight appear to be nearly universally capable of amplifying lycophyte and monilophyte DNAs, and an additional six are useful in at least some groups. To further explore the application of noncoding chloroplast DNA, we analyzed the relative phylogenetic utility of five cpDNA regions for resolving relationships in Botrychium s.l. (Ophioglossaceae). Previous studies have evaluated both the gene rbcL and the trnL(UAA)-trnF(GAA) intergenic spacer in this group. To these published data we added sequences of the trnS(GCU)-trnG(UUC) intergenic spacer + the trnG(UUC) intron region, the trnS(GGA)-rpS4 intergenic spacer+rpS4 gene, and the rpL16 intron. Both the trnS(GCU)-trnG(UUC) and rpL16 regions are highly variable in angiosperms and the trnS(GGA)-rpS4 region has been widely used in monilophyte phylogenetic studies. Phylogenetic resolution was equivalent across regions, but the strength of support for the phylogenies varied among regions. Of the five sampled regions the trnS(GCU)-trnG(UUC) spacer+trnG(UUC) intron region provided the strongest support for the inferred phylogeny.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Previous phylogenetic studies of moonworts (Botrychium sensu stricto (s.s.)) included few taxa from outside of North America. This low geographical representation limited interpretations of relationships of this group rich in cryptic species. With 18 out of 30 species in the genus being polyploid, understanding their evolutionary history remains a major challenge. METHODS A new molecular phylogeny was reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) analyses based on multiple accessions of the most wide-ranging Arctic taxa of Botrychium in North America and Europe using three noncoding plastid DNA regions (psbA-trnH(GUG), trnL(UAA)-trnF(GAA) intergenic spacer, and rpL16 intron). KEY RESULTS The new phylogeny confirms the identity of several recently described species and proposed new taxa. Nine subclades are newly identified within the two major clades in Botrychium s.s.: Lanceolatum and Lunaria. Chloroplast DNA was variable enough to separate morphologically cryptic species in the Lunaria clade. On the contrary, much less variation is seen within the morphologically variable Lanceolatum clade despite sampling over the same broad geographic range. The chloroplast region psbA-trnH(GUG) is identified as an efficient DNA barcode for the identification of cryptic taxa in Botrychium s.s. CONCLUSIONS The combined increase in species representation, samples from throughout the geographic range of each species, and sequencing of multiple plastid DNA regions supports morphologically cryptic species in Botrychium s.s.},

The sister group of Circaea was recently shown to be Fuchsia, which comprises 107 species primarily distributed in montane Central and South America, including four species occurring in the South Pacific islands. Three plastid markers (petB-petD, rpl16, and trnL-F) and nrITS sequences from 13 of the 14 taxa of Circaea were sequenced and used to reconstruct the phylogenetic and biogeographic history of the genus. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses support that (1) Circaea is monophyletic; (2) the bilocular group is a weakly supported clade nested within the unilocular grade; (3) neither the C. alpina complex nor the C. canadensis complex is monophyletic; and (4) the western North American C. alpina subsp. pacifica diverged first in the genus. Divergence time estimates based on the Bayesian "relaxed" clock methods suggest that the earliest Circaea divergence occurred minimally at 16.17 mya (95\% HPD: 7.69-24.53 mya). Biogeographic analyses using divergence-vicariance analysis (DIVA) and a likelihood method support the New World origin of Circaea. Three independent dispersal events between Eurasia and North America via the Bering land bridge were inferred within Circaea. Higher taxon diversity of Circaea in eastern Asia was probably caused by geologic and ecological changes during the late Tertiary in the Northern Hemisphere.},

Combined analysis of these regions indicate Gaura is monophyletic only if it includes Stenosiphon, a monotypic genus comprised of S. linifolius. Within Gaura, our studies indicate that sections Gauridium, Schizocarya, Campogaura, Stipogaura, Xenogaura, and Gaura are monophyletic, but sections Xerogaura and Pterogaura are not and should be reevaluated.

	abstract = {Clarkia (Onagraceae) is a genus of 42 annual species, mostly native to California, that has served as a model for many studies of plant evolutionary biology, particularly morphological, cytological, and genetic divergence; reproductive isolation; and speciation. Section Sympherica is the largest section with eight diploid and one allotetraploid species. Species in the section have provided important evidence about the evolution of reproductive isolation (C. lingulata derived from C. biloba) and large morphological change (C. dudleyana thought to be sister to the morphologically distinct C. heterandra, recently transferred into Clarkia from the monotypic Heterogaura). Clarkia epilobioides, another diploid species in the section, was previously shown to be one parent of the allotetraploid C. delicata, the other parent being C. unguiculata from sect. Phaeostoma. Lewis and Lewis (1955) interpreted the parentage of C. delicata and other evidence of intersectional hybridization to mean that the diploid sections of the genus, though highly diverse, were closely related and should be maintained in the single genus Clarkia. Here we assess phylogenetic relationships among the species of sect. Sympherica and related species by analyzing the nucleotide sequences of PgiC1 and PgiC2, a pair of paralogous genes that encode the cytosolic isozyme of phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9). The major results were the following: (1) C. unguiculata and both genomes of C. delicata are within a well-defined "Sympherica" clade; thus, C. delicata should not be considered an intersectional hybrid; (2) C. heterandra belongs in the clade and is closely related to C. unguiculata; and (3) on the evidence of PgiC1, C. dudleyana is not in the clade and is not closely related to C. heterandra.},

Among the species sampled, there is strong support for a single South Pacific lineage, a southern South American/southern Brazilian lineage, a tropical Andean lineage, and one or two Central American and Mexican lineages. There is no clear support for an austral origin of the genus, as previously proposed, which is more consistent with Fuchsia's sister group relationship with the boreal Circaea. An ultrametric molecular clock analysis (all minimal dates) places the split between Fuchsia and Circaea at 41 million years ago (mya), with the diversification of the modern-day lineages of Fuchsia beginning at 31 mya. The South Pacific Fuchsia lineage branches off around 30 mya, consistent with fossil records from Australia and New Zealand. The large Andean section Fuchsia began to diversify around 22 mya, preceded by the divergence of the Caribbean F. triphylla at 25 mya. The Brazilian members of section Quelusia separated from the southern Andean F. magellanica around 13 mya, and the ancestor of the Tahitian F. cyrtandroides split off from the New Zealand species of section Skinnera approximately 8 mya.},

Although Forsythieae is considered monophyletic, with many symplesiomorphic characters, the phylogenetic status of Abeliophyllum remains controversial. We assessed the phylogenetic relationships of Forsythieae, based on a 3.3-kb plastid fragment (trnL-F region and matK gene) and nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region DNA sequences. We obtained a highly resolved and strongly supported topology with possible outgroups. The topology of the combined tree was congruent with those of the ITS region and matK gene. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference tree analyses for the combined data also yielded identical relationships. Combined sequence data strongly supported the monophyly of Forsythieae and the close relationship between Fontanesia and Jasminum. Oleaceae, not Fontanesia, was found to be a sister group to Forsythieae. Moreover, the genus Abeliophyllum was distinctly independent of Forsythia. Three Forsythia lineages were suggested: (a) ONJ (ovata-nakaii-japonica clade), (b) VGE (viridissima-giraldiana-europaea), and (c) KISS (koreana-intermedia-saxatilis-suspensa). Our results indicated that F. × intermedia is not a hybrid between F. suspensa and F. viridissima, but further studies are needed to determine its taxonomic identity. Furthermore, the diverse fruit shapes in Oleaceae are assumed to be the result of parallelism or convergence.},

Its position within the subtribe Oleinae has, however, been largely unresolved and its evolutionary history has remained unexplored. In this study, we generated a dataset of plastid (trnL-F, trnT-L, trnS-G, trnK-matK) and nuclear (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]) DNA sequences to infer phylogenetic relationships within Oleinae and to examine evolutionary patterns within Noronhia. Our sample included most species of Noronhia and representatives of the ten other extant genera within the subtribe with an emphasis on Chionanthus. Bayesian inferences and maximum likelihood analyses of plastid and nuclear data indicated several instances of paraphyly and polyphyly within Oleinae, with some geographic signal. Both plastid and ITS data showed a polyphyletic Noronhia that included Indian Ocean species of Chionanthus. They also found close relationships between Noronhia and African Chionanthus. However, the plastid data showed little clear differentiation between Noronhia and the African Chionanthus whereas relationships suggested by the nuclear ITS data were more consistent with taxonomy and geography. We used molecular dating to discriminate between hybridization and lineage sorting/gene duplication as alternative explanations for these topological discordances and to infer the biogeographic history of Noronhia. Hybridization between African Chionanthus and Noronhia could not be ruled out. However, Noronhia has long been established in Madagascar after a likely Cenozoic dispersal from Africa, suggesting any hybridization between representatives of African and Malagasy taxa was ancient. In any case, the African and Indian Ocean Chionanthus and Noronhia together formed a strongly supported monophyletic clade distinct and distant from other Chionanthus, which calls for a revised and more conservative taxonomy for this group.},

The nITS phylogeny retrieved the classical view of the evolution of the section, whereas nETS phylogeny indicated an unexpected separation of F. angustifolia in two paraphyletic groups, respectively found in southeastern Europe and in the other parts of the Mediterranean basin. In the nETS phylogeny, the former group was closely related to F. excelsior, whereas the later was closely related to F. mandshurica, a species which is restricted nowadays to northeastern Asia. This topological incongruence between the two loci indicated the occurrence of an ancient reticulation between European and Asian ash species. Several other ancient reticulation events between the two European species and the other species of the section were supported by the posterior predictive checking method. Some of these reticulation events would have occurred during the Miocene, when climatic variations may have lead these species to expand their distribution range and come into contact. The recurrent reticulations observed among Eurasian ash species indicate that they should be considered as conspecific taxa, with subspecific status for some groups. Altogether, the results of the present study provide a rare documented evidence for the occurrence of multiple ancient reticulations within a group of temperate tree taxa with modern disjunct distributions in Eurasia. These ancient reticulation events indicate that the speciation process is slow in ashes, necessitating long periods of geographical isolation. The implications for speciation processes in temperate trees with similar life history and reproductive biology are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The genus Olea (Oleaceae) includes approx. 40 taxa of evergreen shrubs and trees classified in three subgenera, Olea, Paniculatae and Tetrapilus, the first of which has two sections (Olea and Ligustroides). Olive trees (the O. europaea complex) have been the subject of intensive research, whereas little is known about the phylogenetic relationships among the other species. To clarify the biogeographical history of this group, a molecular analysis of Olea and related genera of Oleaceae is thus necessary. METHODS A phylogeny was built of Olea and related genera based on sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 and four plastid regions. Lineage divergence and the evolution of abaxial peltate scales, the latter character linked to drought adaptation, were dated using a Bayesian method. KEY RESULTS Olea is polyphyletic, with O. ambrensis and subgenus Tetrapilus not sharing a most recent common ancestor with the main Olea clade. Partial incongruence between nuclear and plastid phylogenetic reconstructions suggests a reticulation process in the evolution of subgenus Olea. Estimates of divergence times for major groups of Olea during the Tertiary were obtained. CONCLUSIONS This study indicates the necessity of revising current taxonomic boundaries in Olea. The results also suggest that main lines of evolution were promoted by major Tertiary climatic shifts: (1) the split between subgenera Olea and Paniculatae appears to have taken place at the Miocene-Oligocene boundary; (2) the separation of sections Ligustroides and Olea may have occurred during the Early Miocene following the Mi-1 glaciation; and (3) the diversification within these sections (and the origin of dense abaxial indumentum in section Olea) was concomitant with the aridification of Africa in the Late Miocene.},

	abstract = {Ochnaceae s.str. (Malpighiales) are a pantropical family of about 500 species and 27 genera of almost exclusively woody plants. Infrafamilial classification and relationships have been controversial partially due to the lack of a robust phylogenetic framework. Including all genera except Indosinia and Perissocarpa and DNA sequence data for five DNA regions (ITS, matK, ndhF, rbcL, trnL-F), we provide for the first time a nearly complete molecular phylogenetic analysis of Ochnaceae s.l. resolving most of the phylogenetic backbone of the family. Based on this, we present a new classification of Ochnaceae s.l., with Medusagynoideae and Quiinoideae included as subfamilies and the former subfamilies Ochnoideae and Sauvagesioideae recognized at the rank of tribe. Our data support a monophyletic Ochneae, but Sauvagesieae in the traditional circumscription is paraphyletic because Testulea emerges as sister to the rest of Ochnoideae, and the next clade shows Luxemburgia+Philacra as sister group to the remaining Ochnoideae. To avoid paraphyly, we classify Luxemburgieae and Testuleeae as new tribes. The African genus Lophira, which has switched between subfamilies (here tribes) in past classifications, emerges as sister to all other Ochneae. Thus, endosperm-free seeds and ovules with partly to completely united integuments (resulting in an apparently single integument) are characters that unite all members of that tribe. The relationships within its largest clade, Ochnineae (former Ochneae), are poorly resolved, but former Ochninae (Brackenridgea, Ochna) are polyphyletic. Within Sauvagesieae, the genus Sauvagesia in its broad circumscription is polyphyletic as Sauvagesia serrata is sister to a clade of Adenarake, Sauvagesia spp., and three other genera. Within Quiinoideae, in contrast to former phylogenetic hypotheses, Lacunaria and Touroulia form a clade that is sister to Quiina. Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions showed that zygomorphic flowers with adaptations to buzz-pollination (poricidal anthers), a syncarpous gynoecium (a near-apocarpous gynoecium evolved independently in Quiinoideae and Ochninae), numerous ovules, septicidal capsules, and winged seeds with endosperm are the ancestral condition in Ochnoideae. Although in some lineages poricidal anthers were lost secondarily, the evolution of poricidal superstructures secured the maintenance of buzz-pollination in some of these genera, indicating a strong selective pressure on keeping that specialized pollination system.},

	abstract = {Nyssa sylvatica complex consists of several woody taxa occurring in eastern North America. These taxa were recognized as two or three species including three or four varieties by different authors. Due to high morphological similarities and complexity of morphological variation, classification and delineation of taxa in the group have been difficult and controversial. Here we employ data from RAD-seq to elucidate the genetic structure and phylogenetic relationships within the group. Using the genetic evidence, we evaluate previous classifications and delineate species. We also employ Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) to evaluate impacts of climatic changes on the ranges of the taxa and to gain insights into the relevant refugia in eastern North America. Results from Molecular Variance Analysis (AMOVA), STRUCTURE, phylogenetic analyses using Maximum likelihood, Bayesian Inference, and Splittree methods of RAD-seq data strongly support a two-clade pattern, largely separating samples of N. sylvatica from those of N. biflora-N. ursina mix. Divergence time analysis with BEAST suggests the two clades diverged in the mid Miocene. The ancestor of the present trees of N. sylvatica was suggested to be in the Pliocene and that of N. biflora-N. ursina mix in the end of the Miocene. Results from SDM predicted a smaller range in the southern part of the species present range of each clade during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). A northward expansion of the ranges during interglacial period and a northward shift of the ranges in the future under a model of global warming were also predicted. Our results support the recognition of two species in the complex, N. sylvatica and N. biflora, following the phylogenetic species concept. We found no genetic evidence supporting recognitions of intraspecific taxa. However, we propose subsp. ursina and subsp. biflora within N. biflora due to their distinction in habits, distributions, and habitats. Our results further support movements of trees in eastern North America in response to climatic changes. Finally, our study demonstrates that RAD-seq data and a combination of population genomics and SDM are valuable in resolving relationship and biogeographic history of closely related species that are taxonomically difficult.},

Despite this, the Nyctaginaceae have attracted little attention from botanists. To produce a phylogeny for the Nyctaginaceae, we sampled 51 species representing 25 genera (of 28-31) for three chloroplast loci (ndhF, rps16, rpl16, and nrITS) and included all genera from North America. Parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian methods were used to reconstruct the phylogeny for the family. The family is neotropical in origin. A radiation of woody taxa unites Pisonia and Pisoniella with the difficult tropical genera Neea and Guapira, which also form a clade, though neither appears to be monophyletic. This group is sister to a clade containing Bougainvillea, Belemia, and Phaeoptilum. A dramatic radiation of genera occurred in the deserts of North America. The tribe Nyctagineae and its subtribes are paraphyletic, due to over-reliance on a few homoplasious characters, i.e., pollen morphology and involucre presence. Two notable characters associated with the desert radiation are cleistogamy and edaphic endemism on gypsum soils. We discuss evolutionary trends in these traits in light of available data about self-incompatibility and gypsum tolerance in Nyctaginaceae.},

	volume = {61},
	doi = {10.1093/sysbio/syr116},
	abstract = {Although temporal calibration is widely recognized as critical for obtaining accurate divergence-time estimates using molecular dating methods, few studies have evaluated the variation resulting from different calibration strategies. Depending on the information available, researchers have often used primary calibrations from the fossil record or secondary calibrations from previous molecular dating studies. In analyses of flowering plants, primary calibration data can be obtained from macro- and mesofossils (e.g., leaves, flowers, and fruits) or microfossils (e.g., pollen). Fossil data can vary substantially in accuracy and precision, presenting a difficult choice when selecting appropriate calibrations. Here, we test the impact of eight plausible calibration scenarios for Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae, Fagales), a plant genus with a particularly rich and well-studied fossil record. To do so, we reviewed the phylogenetic placement and geochronology of 38 fossil taxa of Nothofagus and other Fagales, and we identified minimum age constraints for up to 18 nodes of the phylogeny of Fagales. Molecular dating analyses were conducted for each scenario using maximum likelihood (RAxML + r8s) and Bayesian (BEAST) approaches on sequence data from six regions of the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. Using either ingroup or outgroup constraints, or both, led to similar age estimates, except near strongly influential calibration nodes. Using "early but risky" fossil constraints in addition to "safe but late" constraints, or using assumptions of vicariance instead of fossil constraints, led to older age estimates. In contrast, using secondary calibration points yielded drastically younger age estimates. This empirical study highlights the critical influence of calibration on molecular dating analyses. Even in a best-case situation, with many thoroughly vetted fossils available, substantial uncertainties can remain in the estimates of divergence times. For example, our estimates for the crown group age of Nothofagus varied from 13 to 113 Ma across our full range of calibration scenarios. We suggest that increased background research should be made at all stages of the calibration process to reduce errors wherever possible, from verifying the geochronological data on the fossils to critical reassessment of their phylogenetic position.},

We examined geographic patterns of intraspecific and interspecific genetic variation to detect whether incongruences in nuclear or plastid DNA phylogenies occur, in order to better understand the evolutionary history of the subgenus Nothofagus. We conducted spatially-explicit sampling at 10 distinct locations throughout the range of austral South American forests and sampled all present Nothofagus species. We used ITS and chloroplast DNA sequences to estimate phylogenetic relationships. A phylogeny constructed from nuclear genes resolved the subgenus Nothofagus as monophyletic. We found that N. antarctica was a sister to a clade of evergreen species (N. betuloides, N. dombeyi, and N. nitida), while N. pumilio likely diverged earlier. Nine cpDNA haplotypes were distinguished in the subgenus Nothofagus which were associated to geographic locations rather than to taxonomic relationships. This species-independent cpDNA phylogeographic structures within the subgenus Nothofagus may be related to repeated chloroplast capture events over geological time in Patagonia.},

	abstract = {During phylogenetic analysis of the Nepenthaceae cpDNA trnK intron, it became apparent that a second non-functional copy of the locus was present in most of the investigated taxa. The translocation event was older than the radiation of all recent Nepenthaceae, and the translocated pseudogenized copy was conserved in nearly all members of the plant family. Using single chloroplast PCR and inverse PCR, we could exclude a plastom location for the second copy. Although translocation into the nucleus is possible, mitochondrial localization seems more likely based on these data. In total, the translocated sequence contained at least 3525 base pairs (bp) that were homologous to the Spinacia oleracea chloroplast genome. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of the non-functional copy revealed a high amount of homoplasies compared to topologies from the cpDNA trnK intron phylogenetic reconstruction. Therefore, this copy proved to be insufficient for phylogenetic reconstruction of the family. Since two different paralogs of the non-functional copy were found in one species, it is feasible that different paralogs were conserved in different groups and that paralogous sequences were included in the data matrix. These data demonstrate that phylogenetic analyses of pseudogenized copies of phylogenetically relevant loci should be performed with great caution. In addition, pseudogenized copies can exist in nearly every member of a plant family, and can be PCR-amplified at levels comparable to the specific copy. In this case, the inclusion of such copies can easily remain unnoticed, thus leading to faulty hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Nepenthaceae, the pitcher plants of the Old World tropics show a remarkable diversity in SE Asia, especially on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. This region is considered as a secondary center of diversity. Sequence analysis of the cpDNA TRNK intron supports this hypothesis showing the species of the Malay Archipelago as neighbour group to the isolated species from Sri Lanka, the Seychelles, and Madagascar. Based on phylogenetic reconstructions an origin of recent Nepenthaceae in the Indian subcontinent is assumed. A recent investigation focused on a non-plastid, translocated copy of the TRNK intron has revealed an incongruence to tree topology based on the cpDNA TRNK intron. Although the translocated copy emerged as insufficient for phylogenetic reconstruction of Nepenthaceae some taxa showed, contrary to the cpDNA dataset, relatively high distances to the rest of the taxa. These results indicated that the phylogeny of the TRNK intron could not reflect true phylogenetic relationships. We investigated the peptide transferase 1 (PTR1), to develop a phylogenetic marker that is based on a nuclear low copy gene in Nepenthes. All sequences obtained were probably functional, indicated by the ratio of point mutations of the single codon positions in exon and intron regions. Comparative analysis showed that this locus is of similar variability as the cpDNA TRNK intron and, contrary to the translocated copy of TRNK, potential useful for phylogenetic reconstruction. While in parts congruent to the plastid TRNK intron phylogeny, a higher divergence of some sequences in PRT1 and in the previously reported, non cpDNA dataset indicates that remnants of an older species stock persisted east of Wallace's line and on the Sunda Shelf. This suggests that plastid haplotypes existing today in the main distribution center of the Nepenthaceae could be descendants of more recently dispersed lineages that had been transmitted to an old species stock.},

	doi = {10.3732/ajb.1400509},
	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Floral display describes the effect of flower size combined with the number of flowers per inflorescence. There is strong evidence that a floral-display trade-off operates under energetic constraint, with few-flowered inflorescences likely to have larger flowers than many-flowered inflorescences. Flower size can be estimated by different variables; thus, we propose that the variable for flower size that is most highly (negatively) correlated with the number of flowers per inflorescence will also be the best estimate of floral cost. Ranking the correlation with the phylogenetic signal of the variable can provide additional insight into the evolution of floral display. METHODS The Myrtales were chosen as a model order based on age, worldwide distribution, and diversity of reproductive strategies. Ninety-nine species representing all families and one quarter of generic diversity across its geographic and ecological range were sampled to reconstruct a phylogeny based on rbcL and ndhF sequences. Correlation coefficients were calculated for flower size variables vs. the number of flowers per inflorescence. Phylogenetic signal was measured for all variables and for floral display. KEY RESULTS Flowers per inflorescence showed significant negative correlation with the following flower size variables (weakest to strongest): filament length {\textless} anther size {\textless} flower depth {\textless} flower diameter. As the correlation of each character with number of flowers per inflorescence rose (suggesting increased cost), the values for phylogenetic signal diminished (suggesting less constraint). CONCLUSIONS We conclude that energetically costly floral characters appear to be less phylogenetically constrained, while low-cost floral characters maintain higher levels of phylogenetic inertia.},

	abstract = {We examine the eudicot order Myrtales, a clade with strong Gondwanan representation for most of its families. Although previous phylogenetic studies greatly improved our understanding of intergeneric and interspecific relationships within the order, our understanding of inter-familial relationships still remains unresolved; hence, we also lack a robust time-calibrated chronogram to address hypotheses (e.g., biogeography and diversification rates) that have implicit time assumptions. Six loci (rbcL, ndhF, matK, matR, 18S, and 26S) were amplified and sequenced for 102 taxa across Myrtales for phylogenetic reconstruction and ten fossil priors were utilized to produce a chronogram in BEAST. Combretaceae is identified as the sister clade to all remaining families with moderate support, and within the latter clade, two strongly supported groups are seen: (1) Onagraceae+Lythraceae, and (2) Melastomataceae+the Crypteroniaceae, Alzateaceae, Penaeaceae clade along with Myrtaceae+Vochysiaceae. Divergence time estimates suggest Myrtales diverged from Geraniales ∼124Mya during the Aptian of the Early Cretaceous. The crown date for Myrtales is estimated at ∼116Mya (Albian-Aptian). BioGeoBEARS showed significant improvement in the likelihood score when the "jump dispersal" parameter was added. South America and/or Africa are implicated as important ancestral areas in all deeper nodes. BAMM analyses indicate that the best configuration included three significant shifts in diversification rates within Myrtales: near the crown of Melastomataceae (∼67-64Mya), along the stem of subfamily Myrtoideae (Myrtaceae; ∼75Mya), and along the stem of tribe Combreteae (Combretaceae; ∼50-45Mya).

	abstract = {Myrteae (c. 2500 species; 51 genera) is the largest tribe of Myrtaceae and an ecologically important groups of angiosperms in the Neotropics. Systematic relationships in Myrteae are complex, hindering conservation initiatives and jeopardizing evolutionary modelling. A well-supported and robust phylogenetic hypothesis was here targeted towards a comprehensive understanding of the relationships within the tribe. The resultant topology was used as a base for key evolutionary analyses such as age estimation, historical biogeography and diversification rate patterns. One nuclear (ITS) and seven chloroplast (psbA-trnH, matK, ndhF, trnl-trnF, trnQ-rps16, rpl16 and rpl32-trnL) DNA regions for 115 taxa representing 46 out of the 51 genera in the tribe were accessed and analysed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference tools for phylogenetic reconstruction. Dates of diversification events were estimated and contrasted using two distinct fossil sets (macro and pollen) in BEAST. The subsequent dated phylogenies were compared and analysed for biogeographical patterns using BioGeoBEARS and diversification rates using BAMM. Myrteae phylogeny presents strong statistical support for three major clades within the tribe: Australasian group, Myrtus group and Main Neotropical Lineage. Dating results from calibration using macrofossil are an average of 20 million years older and show an early Paleocene origin of Myrteae, against a mid-Eocene one from the pollen fossil calibration. Biogeographic analysis shows the origin of Myrteae in Zealandia in both calibration approaches, followed by a widespread distribution throughout the still-linked Gondwana continents and diversification of Neotropical endemic lineages by later vicariance. Best configuration shift indicates three points of acceleration in diversification rates, all of them occurring in the Main Neotropical Lineage. Based on the reconstructed topology, several new taxonomic placements were recovered, including: the relative position of Myrtus communis, the placement of the Blepharocalyx group, the absence of generic endemism in the Caribbean, and the paraphyletism of the former Pimenta group. Distinct calibration approaches affect biogeography interpretation, increasing the number of necessary long distance dispersal events in the topology with older nodes. It is hypothesised that biological intrinsic factors such as modifications of embryo type and polyploidy might have played a role in accelerating shifts of diversification rates in Neotropical lineages. Future perspectives include formal subtribal classification, standardization of fossil calibration approaches and better links between diversification shifts and trait evolution.},

	abstract = {The angiosperm family Myrtaceae has extant and fossil taxa from all southern continents and is assumed to be of Gondwanan origin. Many modern groups contain sister taxa that have disjunct transoceanic distributions, which can be interpreted as a result of either vicariance or long-distance dispersal and establishment (LDDE). Further, some Myrtaceae groups occur on Pacific islands with enigmatic geological histories. We tested hypotheses of vicariance and LDDE by estimating divergence times using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated with 12 fossils. In total, 88 genera and 202 species were sampled, representing both subfamilies and all tribes of Myrtaceae. We reconstructed the family as Gondwanan in origin. Of the 22 geographically disjunct sister groups in our study, up to six are potentially explained as the product of vicariance, three resulting from overland dispersal via new land connections, and 13 due to LDDE events. Nine of the 13 hypothesized LDDE events occurred in fleshy-fruited taxa. Our results indicate that most of the transoceanic distribution patterns in Myrtaceae have occurred since the Miocene due to LDDE, whereas inferred vicariance events all occurred before the Late Eocene. There are many instances of sister relationships between species-poor and species-rich groups in Myrtaceae, and at least three occurrences of geographically isolated taxa on long branches of the phylogeny (Arillastrum, Myrtus, and Tepualia), whose modern-day distributions are difficult to explain without additional fossil or geological evidence.},

The population genetic studies resolved geographically partitioned clusters in E. camaldulensis, E. cladocalyx, E. globulus and E. urophylla that were congruent with previous molecular studies. A phylogenetic study of 94 eucalypt species provided results that were largely congruent with traditional taxonomy and ITS-based phylogenies, but provided more resolution within major clades than had been obtained previously. Ascertainment bias (the bias introduced in a phylogeny from using markers developed in a small sample of the taxa that are being studied) was not detected.

	abstract = {Many recent studies discuss the influence of climatic and geological events in the evolution of Neotropical biota by correlating these events with dated phylogenetic hypotheses. Myrtaceae is one of the most diverse Neotropical groups and it therefore a good proxy of plant diversity in the region. However, biogeographic studies on Neotropical Myrtaceae are still very limited. Myrcia s.l. is an informal group comprising three accepted genera (Calyptranthes, Marlierea and Myrcia) making up the second largest Neotropical group of Myrtaceae, totalling about 700 species distributed in nine subgroups. Exclusively Neotropical, the group occurs along the whole of the Neotropics with diversity centres in the Caribbean, the Guiana Highlands and the central-eastern Brazil. This study aims to identify the time and place of divergence of Myrcia s.l. lineages, to examine the correlation in light of geological and climatic events in the Neotropics, and to explore relationships among Neotropical biogeographic areas. A dated phylogenetic hypothesis was produced using BEAST and calibrated by placing Paleomyrtinaea princetonensis (56Ma) at the root of the tree; biogeographic analysis used the DEC model with dispersal probabilities between areas based on distance and floristic affinities. Myrcia s.l. originated in the Montane Atlantic Forest between the end of Eocene and early Miocene and this region acted as a secondary cradle for several lineages during the evolution of this group. The Caribbean region was important in the diversification of the Calyptranthes clade while the Guayana shield appears as ancestral area for an older subgroup of Myrcia s.l. The Amazon Forest has relatively low diversity of Myrcia s.l. species but appears to have been important in the initial biogeographic history of old lineages. Lowland Atlantic Forest has high species diversity but species rich lineages did not originate in the area. Diversification of most subgroups of Myrcia s.l. occurred throughout the Miocene, as reported for other Neotropical taxa. During the Miocene, geological events may have influenced the evolution of the Caribbean and Amazon forest lineages, but other regions were geological stable and climate changes were the most likely drivers of diversification. The evolution of many lineages in montane areas suggests that Myrcia s.l. may be particularly adapted to such environments.},

This study investigated the utility of a single copy gene, cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR), for resolving phylogenetic relationships at the sectional level within Eucalyptus. The monophyly of sections Exsertaria and Latoangulatae was explored, using section Maidenaria as an outgroup, and the impact of intragenic recombination on phylogenetic reconstruction examined. Phylogenetic analysis did not resolve monophyletic groups. Latoangulatae and Maidenaria were polyphyletic or paraphyletic. Exsertaria species formed a clade but included a single Latoangulatae species (E. major). Recombination analysis identified two intragenic recombination events that involved species from different sections, which have probably been facilitated by inter-sectional hybridisation. One of the events most likely occurred prior to speciation, with several Latoangulatae species having the recombinant allele. The other event may have occurred after speciation, since only one of two E. globulus samples possessed the recombinant allele. This is the first detailed report of intragenic recombination in both CCR and Eucalyptus, and between species of different sections of a plant genus. The occurrence of intragenic recombination may explain the anomalous positions of some species within the phylogenetic tree, and indicates that phylogenetic analysis of Eucalyptus using nuclear genes will be problematic unless recombination is taken into account.},

Phylogenetic relationships among eucalypt genera have been incongruent among datasets in previous studies, where morphological characters supported monophyly of the genus Corymbia, while intergenic spacers of the nuclear ribosomes (ITS) and chloroplast loci (trnL, trnH, psbA) showed Corymbia as either equivocal or paraphyletic. Ribosomal DNA occurs in multiple copies in a genome. We cloned and sequenced the nrITS to investigate if gene duplication was the cause of incongruence among trees in the eucalypts. Three ITS riboforms, two of them widespread, were recovered within some genomes. One of the ITS riboforms recovered a robust phylogeny showing Corymbia as a monophyletic genus, corroborating the evidence from morphology, fossil data, a recent ITS/ETS dataset and microsatellites (SSRs). Compelling evidence suggested that this divergent riboform is a pseudogene, i.e., non-functional paralog: comparatively lower GC content suggesting lower structural stability, deamination-like mutations at potential methylation sites, lack of conserved helices and hairpins and conspicuously lower thermodynamic stability in secondary structures. Phylogenies from the apparently functional riboform retained Corymbia as paraphyletic. We show here that pseudogenes can recover a well-corroborated phylogeny whereas their functional paralogs show misleading hypotheses. We explain that phylogenetic signals may be obscured when functional constraints in ITS necessitate compensatory mutations in the secondary structure helices involved in RNA transcription, whereas pseudogenes mutate under neutrality.},

Relationships are reconstructed within Myrceugenia from four plastid markers (partial trnK-matK, rpl32-trnL, trnQ-5'rps16 and rpl16) and two ribosomal nuclear regions (ETS and ITS) using maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Relationships inferred previously from morphological data are not completely consistent with those from molecular data. All molecular analyses support the hypothesis that Myrceugenia is monophyletic, except for M. fernadeziana that falls outside the genus. Chilean species and Brazilian species form two separate lineages. Chilean species form three early diverging clades, whereas Brazilian species are a strongly supported monophyletic group in a terminal position. Least average evolutionary divergence, low resolution, short branches, and high species diversity found in the Brazilian clade suggest rapid radiation.

It is expected that cryptic species are more common in groups where there are life histories or genetic architectures that promote speciation in the absence of apparent morphological differentiation. Chromosomal rearrangements have the potential to lead to post-zygotic isolation and might be an important factor leading to cryptic species. Here we investigate the potential role of chromosomal change in driving speciation in the karyotypically diverse scale insect genus Apiomorpha, focussing on four species placed in the same species group (the A. minor species group Gullan, 1984). Using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data, we find that Apiomorpha minor is not monophyletic and consists of at least nine cryptic species. Diploid chromosome counts range from 2n=4 to 2n=84 across the four currently recognized species, and some of the chromosomal variation exists in the absence of other genetic or host use differences, consistent with karyotypic changes being involved in lineage divergence and the generation of cryptic species.},

To date, no DNA marker has been found capable of resolving phylogeny below the sectional level in the major subgenera.

We examined the utility of 930 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) for analyzing relationships among Tasmanian taxa of subgenus Symphyomyrtus section Maidenaria. Phenetic and cladistic analyses resolved species into clusters demonstrating significant genetic partitioning, largely concordant with series defined in the most recent taxonomic revision of Eucalyptus. Some departures from current taxonomy were noted, indicating possible cases of morphological convergence and character reversion. Although the resolution obtained using AFLP was greatly superior to that of single sequence markers, the data demonstrated high homoplasy and incomplete resolution of closely related species. The results of this study and others are consistent with recent speciation and reticulate evolution in Maidenaria. We conclude that a combination of phylogenetic and population genetic approaches using multiple molecular markers offers the best prospects for understanding taxonomic relationships below the sectional level in Eucalyptus.},

At lower levels there were numerous inconsistencies between the morphological treatment and the molecular phylogeny, and taxa within the three main sections were generally not monophyletic at the series (at least 62\% polyphyly) or species (at least 52\% polyphyly) level. Some of the discrepancies appear to be the result of morphological convergence or misclassifications, and we propose some taxonomic reassessments to address this. However, many inconsistencies appear to be the products of incomplete speciation and/or hybridisation. Our analysis represents a significant advance on previous phylogenies of these important eucalypt sections (which have mainly used single samples to represent each species), thus providing a robust phylogenetic framework for evolutionary and ecological studies.},

	abstract = {Reticulate evolution by hybridization is considered a common process shaping the evolution of many plant species, however, reticulation could also be due to incomplete lineage sorting in biodiverse systems. For our study we selected a group of closely related plant taxa with contrasting yet partially overlapping geographic distributions and different population sizes, to distinguish between reticulated patterns due to hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. We predicted that sympatric or proximal populations of different species are more likely to have gene flow than geographically distant populations of the same widespread species. Furthermore, for species with restricted distributions, and therefore, small effective population sizes, we predicted complete lineage sorting. Eastern grey box eucalypt species (Eucalyptus supraspecies Moluccanae) provide an ideal system to explore patterns of reticulate evolution. They form a diverse, recently evolved and phylogenetically undefined group within Eucalyptus, with overlapping morphological features and hybridization in nature. We used a multi-faceted approach, combining analyses of chloroplast and nuclear DNA, as well as seedling morphology, flowering time and ecological spatial differentiation in order to test for species delimitation and reticulate evolution in this group. The multiple layers of results were consistent and suggested a lack of monophyly at different hierarchical levels due to multidirectional gene flow among several species, challenging species delimitation. Chloroplast and nuclear haplotypes were shared among different species in geographic proximity, consistent with hybridization zones. Furthermore, species with restricted distributions appeared better resolved due to lineage sorting in the absence of hybridization. We conclude that a combination of molecular, morphological and ecological approaches is required to disentangle patterns of reticulate evolution in the box eucalypts.},

Several characteristics, including the influence of RNA secondary structure on the mutational dynamics of ITS, may impact on the accuracy of phylogenies estimated from these regions. Here, we develop RNA secondary structure predictions for representatives of the angiosperm family Myrtaceae. On this basis, we assess the utility of structural (stem vs. loop) partitioning, and RNA-specific (paired-sites) models for a 76 taxon Syzygium alignment, and for a broader, family-wide Myrtaceae ITS data set. We use a permutation approach to demonstrate that structural partitioning significantly improves the likelihood of the data. Similarly, models that account for the non-independence of stem-pairs in RNA structure have a higher likelihood than those that do not. The best-fit RNA models for ITS are those that exclude simultaneous double substitutions in stem-pairs, which suggests an absence of strong selection against non-canonical (G.U/U.G) base-pairs at a high proportion of stem-paired sites. We apply the RNA-specific models to the phylogeny of Syzygium and Myrtaceae and contrast these with hypotheses derived using standard 4-state models. There is little practical difference amongst relationships inferred for Syzygium although for Myrtaceae, there are several differences. The RNA-specific approach finds topologies that are less resolved but are more consistent with conventional views of myrtaceous relationships, compared with the 4-state models.},

We use 41 complete chloroplast genome sequences, adding 39 finished-quality chloroplast genomes to two previously published genomes. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses, based on {\textgreater}7000 variable nucleotide positions, produced one fully resolved phylogenetic tree (35 supported nodes, 27 with 100\% bootstrap support). Eucalyptus and its sister lineage Angophora+Corymbia show a deep divergence. Within Eucalyptus, three lineages are resolved: the 'eudesmid', 'symphyomyrt' and 'monocalypt' groups. Corymbia is paraphyletic with respect to Angophora. Gene content and order do not vary among eucalypt chloroplasts; length mutations, especially frame shifts, are uncommon in protein-coding genes. Some non-synonymous mutations are highly incongruent with the overall phylogenetic signal, notably in rbcL, and may be adaptive. Application of custom informatics pipelines (GYDLE Inc.) enabled direct chloroplast genome assembly, resolving each genome to finished-quality with no need for PCR gap-filling or contig order resolution. Analysis of whole chloroplast genomes resolved major eucalypt clades and revealed variable regions of the genome that will be useful in lower-level genetic studies (including phylogeography and geneflow).},

These paralogues, which include non-functional pseudogenes, probably diverged prior to the differentiation of species groups in subg. Eucalyptus. When compared with presumably functional sequences, the pseudogenes show greater sequence variation between species, particularly in the 5.8S gene. They are also characterised by reduced GC content, associated with a reduced number of CpG and CpNpG methylation sites, and an increase in the inferred number of methylation-induced substitutions. Some pseudogenes also lack motifs that are usually conserved in plants, both in ITS1 and the 5.8S gene. Two main lineages of pseudogenes are identified, one isolated from a group of western Australian species, one from a group of eastern Australian species. It is not clear whether these two lineages of pseudogenes are orthologous, or represent independent divergences from functional sequence types. The presence of divergent rDNA paralogues highlights the need for caution when interpreting eucalypt phylogenies based on ITS sequences.},

Additional barcodes need to be evaluated to improve the level of discrimination between plant species. Because of their well-studied taxonomy and extreme diversity, we used Chinese Lysimachia (Myrsinaceae) species to test the performance of core barcodes (rbcL and matK) and two additional candidate barcodes (trnH-psbA and the nuclear ribosomal ITS); 97 accessions from four subgenus representing 34 putative Lysimachia species were included in this study. And many closely related species pairs in subgen. Lysimachia were covered to detect their discriminatory power. The inefficiency of rbcL and matK alone or combined in closely related plant groups was validated in this study. TrnH-psbA combined with rbcL + matK did not yet perform well in Lysimachia groups. In contrast, ITS, alone or combined with rbcL and/or matK, revealed high resolving ability in Lysimachia. We support ITS as a supplementary barcode on the basis of core barcode rbcL and matK. Besides, this study also illustrates several mistakes or underlying evolutionary events in Lysimachia detected by DNA barcoding.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The impact of global climate change on plant distribution, speciation and extinction is of current concern. Examining species climatic preferences via bioclimatic niche modelling is a key tool to study this impact. There is an established link between bioclimatic niche models and phylogenetic diversification. A next step is to examine future distribution predictions from a phylogenetic perspective. We present such a study using Cyclamen (Myrsinaceae), a group which demonstrates morphological and phenological adaptations to its seasonal Mediterranean-type climate. How will the predicted climate change affect future distribution of this popular genus of garden plants? RESULTS We demonstrate phylogenetic structure for some climatic characteristics, and show that most Cyclamen have distinct climatic niches, with the exception of several wide-ranging, geographically expansive, species. We reconstruct climate preferences for hypothetical ancestral Cyclamen. The ancestral Cyclamen lineage has a preference for the seasonal Mediterranean climate characteristic of dry summers and wet winters. Future bioclimatic niches, based on BIOCLIM and Maxent models, are examined with reference to a future climate scenario for the 2050s. Over the next 50 years we predict a northward shift in the area of climatic suitability, with many areas of current distribution becoming climatically unsuitable. The area of climatic suitability for every Cyclamen species is predicted to decrease. For many species, there may be no areas with a suitable climate regardless of dispersal ability, these species are considered to be at high risk of extinction. This risk is examined from a phylogenetic perspective. CONCLUSION Examining bioclimatic niches from a phylogenetic perspective permits novel interpretations of these models. In particular, reconstruction of ancestral niches can provide testable hypothesis about the historical development of lineages. In the future we can expect a northwards shift in climatic suitability for the genus Cyclamen. If this proves to be the case then dispersal is the best chance of survival, which seems highly unlikely for ant-dispersed Cyclamen. Human-assisted establishment of Cyclamen species well outside their native ranges offers hope and could provide the only means of dispersal to potentially suitable future environments. Even without human intervention the phylogenetic perspective demonstrates that major lineages could survive climate change even if many species are lost.},

To test this co-speciation hypothesis, we constructed an endosymbiont (16S rDNA and gyrB) and host (rps16, trnL, matK and ITS) phylogeny. Phylogenetic analyses of the endosymbionts revealed a pattern of strict host specificity and recovered a single clade in the genus Burkholderia (β-proteobacteria), which was closely related to the endosymbionts of leaf-nodulated Rubiaceae. Comparison of symbiont and host phylogenies suggests a single origin of bacterial leaf symbiosis in the nodulated ancestor of Ardisia and does not reject the co-speciation hypothesis.},

Here, we use restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to identify candidate loci that will help in determining phylogenetic relationships among Morella rubra, M. adenophora, M. nana and M. esculenta. Three methods for inferring phylogeny, maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian concordance, were applied to data sets including as many as 4253 RAD loci with 8360 parsimony informative variable sites. All three methods significantly favored the topology of (((M. rubra, M. adenophora), M. nana), M. esculenta). Two species from North America (M. cerifera and M. pensylvanica) were placed as sister to the four Chinese species. According to BEAST analysis, we deduced speciation of M. rubra to be at about the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (5.28 Ma). Intraspecific divergence in M. rubra occurred in the late Pliocene (3.39 Ma). From pooled data, we assembled 29378, 21902 and 23552 de novo contigs with an average length of 229, 234 and 234 bp for M. rubra, M. nana and M. esculenta respectively. The contigs were used to investigate functional classification of RAD tags in a BLASTX search. Additionally, we identified 3808 unlinked SNP sites across the four populations of M. rubra and discovered genes associated with fruit ripening and senescence, fruit quality and disease/defense metabolism based on KEGG database.},

The phylogenetic position of those species was then compared to their specificity of association with Frankia in their natural habitat and to their nodulation potential determined on greenhouse-grown seedlings. The results showed that Genus Myrica, including M. gale and M. hartwegii, and Genus Comptonia, including C. peregrina, belong to a phylogenetic cluster distinct from the other Myrica species transferred in a new genus, Morella. This grouping parallels the natural specificity of each cluster with Comptonia-Myrica and Morella being nodulated by two phylogenetically divergent clusters of Frankia strains, the Alnus and Elaeagnaceae-infective strains clusters, respectively. Under laboratory conditions, Comptonia and Morella had a nodulation potential larger than under natural conditions. From this study it appears that the Myricaceae are split into two different specificity groups. It can be hypothesized that the early divergence of the genera led to the selection of genetically diverse Frankia strains which is contradictory to the earlier proposal that evolution has proceeded toward narrower promiscuity within the family.},

Most species of the family (around 65 species) have been placed under the genus Musa and its infrageneric classification has long been disputed. In this study, we obtained nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast (atpB-rbcL, rps16, and trnL-F) DNA sequences of 36 species (42 accessions of ingroups representing three genera) together with 10 accessions of ingroups retrieved from GenBank database and 4 accessions of outgroups, to construct the phylogeny of the family, with a special reference to the infrageneric classification of the genus Musa. Our phylogenetic analyses elaborated previous results in supporting the monophyly of the family and suggested that Musella and Ensete may be congeneric or at least closely related, but refuted the previous infrageneric classification of Musa. None of the five sections of Musa previously defined based on morphology was recovered as monophyletic group in the molecular phylogeny. Two infrageneric clades were identified, which corresponded well to the basic chromosome numbers of x=11 and 10/9/7, respectively: the former clade comprises species from the sections Musa and Rhodochlamys while the latter contains sections of Callimusa, Australimusa, and Ingentimusa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The classification of the Musaceae (banana) family species and their phylogenetic inter-relationships remain controversial, in part due to limited nucleotide information to complement the morphological and physiological characters. In this work the evolutionary relationships within the Musaceae family were studied using 13 species and DNA sequences obtained from a set of 19 unlinked nuclear genes. RESULTS The 19 gene sequences represented a sample of {\textasciitilde}16 kb of genome sequence ({\textasciitilde}73\% intronic). The sequence data were also used to obtain estimates for the divergence times of the Musaceae genera and Musa sections. Nucleotide variation within the sample confirmed the close relationship of Australimusa and Callimusa sections and showed that Eumusa and Rhodochlamys sections are not reciprocally monophyletic, which supports the previous claims for the merger between the two latter sections. Divergence time analysis supported the previous dating of the Musaceae crown age to the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary ({\textasciitilde} 69 Mya), and the evolution of Musa to {\textasciitilde}50 Mya. The first estimates for the divergence times of the four Musa sections were also obtained. CONCLUSIONS The gene sequence-based phylogeny presented here provides a substantial insight into the course of speciation within the Musaceae. An understanding of the main phylogenetic relationships between banana species will help to fine-tune the taxonomy of Musaceae.},

The Moraceae are centered in the tropics which has invited the hypothesis that the family has Gondwanan origins and extant distribution is the result of vicariance due to the break-up of Gondwana. However, the cosmopolitan distribution of Moraceae suggests a more complicated biogeographical history. The timing and location of Moraceae diversification also bears on the origin of the fig pollination mutualism, a model for the study of coevolution and specialization. Recent molecular dating of pollinating fig wasps suggested that an ancient Gondwanan origin coupled with vicariance and dispersal could account for the present day distribution of the mutualism. Here, we provide the first assessment of this hypothesis based on dating of figs and their relatives. Minimum age estimates suggest that the Moraceae had diversified by at least the mid-Cretaceous and major clades including the figs may have radiated during the Tertiary after the break-up of Gondwanaland. Molecular evidence together with Eurasian fossils suggest that the early diversification of Moraceae in Eurasia and subsequent migration into the southern hemisphere is at least as plausible as the Gondwanan hypothesis. These findings invite a reevaluation of the biogeography of fig pollination and highlight the need for incorporating multiple sources of evidence in biogeographical reconstructions.},

Here, we test whether there is a connection between the fig breeding system and copollinator incidence and diversification by conducting a meta-analysis of molecular data from pollinators of 119 fig species that includes new data from 15 Asian fig species. We find that the incidence of copollinators is not significantly different between monoecious and dioecious Ficus. Surprisingly, while all copollinators in dioecious figs are sister taxa, only 32.1\% in monoecious figs are sister taxa.

The results of the phylogenetic analyses do not conform to any previously proposed taxonomic subdivision of the section and characters used for previous classification are homoplasious. Geographic distribution, however, is highly conserved and Melanesian Malvanthera are monophyletic. A new subdivision of section Malvanthera reflecting phylogenetic relationships is presented. Section Malvanthera likely diversified during a period of isolation in Australia and subsequently colonized New Guinea. Two Australian series are consistent with a pattern of dispersal out of rainforest habitat into drier habitats accompanied by a reduction in plant height during the transition from hemi-epiphytic trees to lithophytic trees and shrubs.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Hybridization events are relatively common in vascular plants. However, the frequency of these events is unevenly distributed across the plant phylogeny. Plant families in which individual species are pollinated by specific pollinator species are predicted to be less prone to hybridization than other families. However, exceptions may occur within these families, when pollinators shift host-plant species. Indeed, host shifts are expected to increase the rate of hybridization events. Pollinators of Ficus section Galoglychia are suspected to have changed host repeatedly, based on several cases of incongruence between plant phylogeny and taxonomy, and insect phylogeny and taxonomy. We tracked cyto-nuclear discordance across section Galoglychia as evidence for hybridization. To achieve a proper global view, we first clarified the monophyly of section Galoglychia as it had been questioned by recent phylogenetic studies. Moreover, we investigated if fig size could be a factor facilitating host shifts. RESULTS Phylogenetic chloroplast and nuclear results demonstrated the monophyly of section Galoglychia. Within section Galoglychia, we detected several cases of statistically significant cyto-nuclear discordance. Discordances concern both terminal nodes of the phylogenetic trees and one deep node defining relationships between subsections. Because nuclear phylogeny is congruent with morphological taxonomy, discordances were caused by the chloroplast phylogeny. Introgressive hybridization was the most likely explanation for these discordances. We also detected that subsections pollinated by several wasp genera had smaller figs and were pollinated by smaller wasps than subsections pollinated by a single wasp genus. CONCLUSION As hypothesized, we discovered evidences of past hybridization in Ficus section Galoglychia. Further, introgression was only detected in subsections presenting incongruence between plant and pollinator phylogenies and taxonomy. This supports the hypothesis that host shift is the cause for plant-pollinator incongruence. Moreover, small fig size could facilitate host shifts. Eventually, this study demonstrates that non-coding chloroplast markers are valuable to resolve deep nodes in Ficus phylogeny.},

The hemiepiphytes of section Americanae are the most diversified with c. 120 species, whereas section Pharmacosycea includes about 20 species mostly with a terrestrial habit. To reconstruct the biogeographical history and diversification of Ficus in the Americas, we produced a dated Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis of Neotropical Ficus including two thirds of the species sequenced for five nuclear regions (At103, ETS, G3pdh, ITS/5.8S and Tpi). Ancestral range was estimated using all models available in Biogeobears and Binary State Speciation and Extinction analysis was used to evaluate the role of the initial habit and propagule size in diversification. The phylogenetic analyses resolved both Neotropical sections as monophyletic but the internal relationships between species in section Americanae remain unclear. Ficus started their diversification in the Neotropics between the Oligocene and Miocene. The genus experienced two bursts of diversification: in the middle Miocene and the Pliocene. Colonization events from the Amazon to adjacent areas coincide with the end of the Pebas system (10 Mya) and the connection of landmasses. Divergence of endemic species in the Atlantic forest is inferred to have happened after its isolation and the opening and consolidation of the Cerrado. Our results suggest a complex diversification in the Atlantic forest differing between postulated refuges and more instable areas in the South distribution of the forest. Finally the selection for initial hemiepiphytic habit and small to medium propagule size influenced the diversification and current distribution of the species at Neotropical forests marked by the historical instability and long-distance dispersal.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Maclura (ca. 12spp., Moraceae) is a widespread genus of trees and woody climbers found on five continents. Maclura pomifera, the Osage orange, is considered a classic example of an anachronistic fruit. Native to the central USA, the grapefruit-sized Osage oranges are unpalatable and have no known extant native dispersers, leading to speculation that the fruits were adapted to extinct megafauna. Our aim was to reconstruct the phylogeny, estimate divergence dates, and infer ancestral ranges of Maclura in order to test the monophyly of subgeneric classifications and to understand evolution and dispersal patterns in this globally distributed group. METHODS Employing Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods, we reconstructed the Maclura phylogeny using two nuclear and five chloroplast loci from all Maclura species and outgroups representing all Moraceae tribes. We reconstructed ancestral ranges and syncarp sizes using a family level dated tree, and used Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models to test for significant changes in syncarp size in the Osage orange lineage. KEY RESULTS Our analyses support a monophyletic Maclura with a Paleocene crown. Subgeneric sections were monophyletic except for the geographically-disjunct Cardiogyne. There was strong support for current species delineations except in the widespread M. cochinchinensis. South America was reconstructed as the ancestral range for Maclura with subsequent colonization of Africa and the northern hemisphere. The clade containing M. pomifera likely diverged in the Oligocene, closely coinciding with crown divergence dates of the mammoth/mastodon and sloth clades that contain possible extinct dispersers. The best fitting model for syncarp size evolution indicated an increase in both syncarp size and the rate of syncarp size evolution in the Osage orange lineage. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that M. pomifera was adapted to dispersal by extinct megafauna. In addition, we consider dispersal rather than vicariance to be most likely responsible for the present distribution of Maclura, as crown divergence post-dated the separation of Africa and South America. We propose revised sectional delimitations based on the phylogeny. This study represents a complete phylogenetic and biogeographic analysis of this globally distributed genus and provides a basis for future work, including a taxonomic revision.},

	abstract = {It is thought that speciation in phytophagous insects is often due to colonization of novel host plants, because radiations of plant and insect lineages are typically asynchronous. Recent phylogenetic comparisons have supported this model of diversification for both insect herbivores and specialized pollinators. An exceptional case where contemporaneous plant-insect diversification might be expected is the obligate mutualism between fig trees (Ficus species, Moraceae) and their pollinating wasps (Agaonidae, Hymenoptera). The ubiquity and ecological significance of this mutualism in tropical and subtropical ecosystems has long intrigued biologists, but the systematic challenge posed by {\textgreater}750 interacting species pairs has hindered progress toward understanding its evolutionary history. In particular, taxon sampling and analytical tools have been insufficient for large-scale cophylogenetic analyses. Here, we sampled nearly 200 interacting pairs of fig and wasp species from across the globe. Two supermatrices were assembled: on an average, wasps had sequences from 77\% of 6 genes (5.6 kb), figs had sequences from 60\% of 5 genes (5.5 kb), and overall 850 new DNA sequences were generated for this study. We also developed a new analytical tool, Jane 2, for event-based phylogenetic reconciliation analysis of very large data sets. Separate Bayesian phylogenetic analyses for figs and fig wasps under relaxed molecular clock assumptions indicate Cretaceous diversification of crown groups and contemporaneous divergence for nearly half of all fig and pollinator lineages. Event-based cophylogenetic analyses further support the codiversification hypothesis. Biogeographic analyses indicate that the present-day distribution of fig and pollinator lineages is consistent with a Eurasian origin and subsequent dispersal, rather than with Gondwanan vicariance. Overall, our findings indicate that the fig-pollinator mutualism represents an extreme case among plant-insect interactions of coordinated dispersal and long-term codiversification.

	abstract = {Standard Sanger chloroplast markers provide limited information to resolve species level relationships within plants, in particular within large genera. Figs (Ficus L., Moraceae) compose one of the 50 largest genera of angiosperms with ∼750 species occurring in the tropics and subtropics worldwide. Figs, in addition to being a keystone food resource in rainforests, are well-known for the mutualistic interactions with their pollinating wasps. It is regarded as a model system for understanding co-evolution dating back more than 75million years. However, despite significant taxon sampling, combinations of low copy nuclear, nuclear ribosomal and chloroplast regions have not been able to confidently resolve relationships among major groups of figs. Using a high throughput sequencing approach we attempted to resolve the major lineages of Ficus based on plastome data. In this study, we show that the use of a de novo assembled plastome from within the genus provides less ambiguity and higher coverage across the 59 Ficus and 6 outgroup plastome assemblies compared to using the nearest available reference plastome outside the genus resulting in improved resolution and higher support of the phylogenetic relationships within Ficus inferred from plastome data. Chloroplast genome data confidently resolved relationships among major groups of figs and largely support current understanding based on nuclear sequence data including passively pollinated Neotropical section Pharmacosycea as sister lineage to all other Ficus. However, conflicts between the new plastome topology and previous nuclear studies are observed for both individual species as well as relationships among some sections at deeper levels. Conflicts could be caused by lack of resolution in the nuclear data or may indicate potential cyto-nuclear discordance as previously observed in an African lineage of Ficus.},

The factors underlying lineage-specific niche lability are still not well understood. We examined morphological and climate niche evolution in Montiaceae (Caryophyllales), an ecologically variable plant lineage distributed primarily along the mountain chains of the western Americas. Montiaceae inhabit a broader range of temperatures than their relatives, with an increase in the evolutionary rate of temperature niche diversification at the node subtending this clade. Within Montiaceae, life history is highly labile and significantly correlated with temperature, with perennials consistently occurring in cooler environments. This elevated evolutionary lability facilitated repeated shifts between habitats as new environments were created by post-Eocene orogenic events and aridification in the western Americas. The shifts between annual and perennial forms are elaborations of an underlying rosette body plan in most cases, and may involve simple alterations in biomass allocation. Montiaceae stand as another clear counterexample to phylogenetic niche conservatism, and demonstrate a mechanism by which pronounced ecological shifts may occur frequently and rapidly among closely related species.},

	abstract = {C(4) photosynthesis is a series of biochemical and structural modifications to C(3) photosynthesis that has evolved numerous times in flowering plants, despite requiring modification of up to hundreds of genes. To study the origin of C(4) photosynthesis, we reconstructed and dated the phylogeny of Molluginaceae, and identified C(4) taxa in the family. Two C(4) species, and three clades with traits intermediate between C(3) and C(4) plants were observed in Molluginaceae. C(3)-C(4) intermediacy evolved at least twice, and in at least one lineage was maintained for several million years. Analyses of the genes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, a key C(4) enzyme, indicate two independent origins of fully developed C(4) photosynthesis in the past 10 million years, both within what was previously classified as a single species, Mollugo cerviana. The propensity of Molluginaceae to evolve C(3)-C(4) and C(4) photosynthesis is likely due to several traits that acted as developmental enablers. Enlarged bundle sheath cells predisposed some lineages for the evolution of C(3)-C(4) intermediacy and the C(4) biochemistry emerged via co-option of photorespiratory recycling in C(3)-C(4) intermediates. These evolutionarily stable transitional stages likely increased the evolvability of C(4) photosynthesis under selection environments brought on by climate and atmospheric change in recent geological time.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY Caryophyllales are highly diverse in the structure of the perianth and androecium and show a mode of floral development unique in eudicots, reflecting the continuous interplay of gynoecium and perianth and their influence on position, number, and identity of the androecial whorls. The floral development of five species from four genera of a paraphyletic Molluginaceae (Limeum, Hypertelis, Glinus, Corbichonia), representing three distinct evolutionary lineages, was investigated to interpret the evolution of the androecium across Caryophyllales. • METHODS Floral buds were dissected, critical-point dried and imaged with SEM. The genera studied are good representatives of the diversity of development of stamens and staminodial petaloids in Caryophyllales. • KEY RESULTS Sepals show evidence of petaloid differentiation via marginal hyaline expansion. Corbichonia, Glinus, and Limeum also show perianth differentiation via sterilization of outer stamen tiers. In all four genera, stamens initiate with the carpels and develop centrifugally, but subsequently variation is significant. With the exception of Limeum, the upper whorl is complete and alternisepalous, while a second antesepalous whorl arises more or less sequentially, starting opposite the inner sepals. Loss or sterilization of antesepalous stamens occurs in Glinus and Limeum and is caused by altered carpel merism and inhibition by sepal pressures. • CONCLUSIONS Outer stamens of Hypertelis correspond with petaloids of Caryophyllaceae and suggest that staminodial petaloids and outer alternisepalous stamens are interchangeable in the Caryophyllales. We emphasize a switch in the position of first formed stamens from antesepalous to alternisepalous following the divergence of Limeum; thus stamen position is an important synapomorphy for the globular inclusion clade.},

	abstract = {Sequences of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions ITS1 and ITS2 have been used widely in molecular phylogenetic studies because of their relatively high variability and facility of amplification. For phylogenetic applications, most researchers use sequence alignments that are based on nucleotide similarity. However, confidence in the alignment often deteriorates at taxonomic levels above genus, due to increasing variability among sequences. Like ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and other RNA molecules, the ITS transcripts consist in part of conserved secondary structures ('stems' and 'loops') that can be predicted by mathematical algorithm. Researchers have long considered the evolutionary conservation of rRNA secondary structure, but until recently few phylogenetic analyses of the ITS regions specifically incorporated structural data. We outline a novel method by which to derive additional phylogenetic data from ITS secondary structure in order to evaluate support for relationships at higher taxonomic levels. To illustrate the method, we describe an example from the plant family Menyanthaceae. Using predicted ITS secondary structure data, we obtained a well-resolved and moderately supported phylogeny, in which most topological relationships were congruent with the tree constructed using ITS nucleotide sequence data. Furthermore, the explicit encoding of ITS structural data in a phylogenetic framework allowed for the reconstruction of putative ancestral states and structural evolution in the functional but highly variable ITS region.},

The study is important since menispermaceous endocarps appear often in the fossil record and indicate the presence of a wet forest ecosystem. • METHODS Three chloroplast regions were used to derive phylogenies for 53 genera and 60 species. Endocarps of 47 genera and 92 species were dissected and morphological characters scored. Photographs of key features are presented. We superimposed our morphological matrix onto the phylogeny to explore character evolution. A detailed key to fruits is presented, allowing identification of extant and fossil specimens to the level of clade or genus. • KEY RESULTS Menispermaceae consists of two major subfamilies: Tinosporoideae and Menispermoideae. Within Tinosporoideae, tribe Coscineae is basal. Within Menispermoideae, tribe Menispermeae is basal. Tinosporoideae consists mainly of taxa with apical style scars, bilateral curvature, subhemispherical condyles, and foliaceous cotyledons with divaricate or imbricate orientation. Menispermoideae consists almost entirely of taxa with basal or subbasal style scars, dorsoventral curvature, bilaterally and/or dorsoventrally compressed condyles, and subterete or fleshy cotyledons oriented dorsoventrally or laterally. • CONCLUSIONS Several fruit characters differentiate major clades, and further synapomorphies are diagnostic of various subclades. Fruit characters that can be inferred as ancestral in the family are basal or subbasal stylar scars, endocarps with dorsoventral curvature, endocarp walls woody or bony, presence of a condyle, locule without ribs, sublateral vascular traces, presence of endosperm, and foliaceous or subterete cotyledons.},

Hengchun Peninsula, is notably floristically different from northern Taiwan. The floristic origin and relationships of the Hengchun Peninsula have been rarely investigated in a phylogenetic context. In this study, data from six plastid and nuclear sequences were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within Burasaieae (Menispermaceae), which mainly inhabits tropical rainforests. The tree-based comparisons indicate that the position of Tinospora sensu stricto conflicts significantly between the cpDNA and ITS trees. However, alternative hypothesis tests from the ITS data did not reject the result of the cpDNA data, which suggests that tree-based comparisons might sometimes generate an artificial incongruence, especially when markers with high homoplasy are used. Based on the combined cpDNA and ITS data, we present an inter-generic phylogenetic framework for Burasaieae. Sampled species of Tinospora are placed in three different clades, including Tinospora dentata from southern Taiwan and T. sagittata from mainland China in an unresolved position alongside six lineages of Burasaieae. By integrating lines of evidence from molecular phylogeny, divergence times, and morphology, we recognize the three Tinospora clades as three different genera, including Tinospora sensu stricto, a new genus (Paratinospora) for T. dentata and T. sagittata, and Hyalosepalum resurrected. Tinospora dentata, now endemic to the Hengchun Peninsula, originated from the Late Eocene (ca. 39Ma), greatly predating the formation of Taiwan. Our study suggests that the flora of the Hengchun Peninsula contains some ancient components that might have migrated from mainland China.},

We used the genus Melianthus to explore the diversification of the southern African flora. Melianthus comprises eight species, and a phylogeny based on one nuclear and two plastid genes, as well as a morphological data set, confirmed that the genus is monophyletic. The two earliest diverging lineages are found in relatively mesic habitats, whereas the two terminal clades (an eastern and a western clade), each with three species, favor more arid habitats. The eastern clade is largely restricted to the summer-rainfall parts of southern Africa, and the western clade is found in winter-rainfall region. Molecular dating indicates a mid-Tertiary origin of the genus, with diversification of the eastern and western clades coincident with the Late Miocene-Pliocene uplift of the Escarpment mountains and the establishment of summer aridity along the west coast. The remarkably complex flowers are indicative of sunbird pollination, but many smaller birds can also visit. Speciation may be the consequence of allopatric divergence into edaphic-climatic niches. Divergence in flower and inflorescence morphology might be in response to the divergent pressures for nectar conservation in arid regions coupled with the need for signaling to avian pollinators in generally shrubby vegetation.},

Populations in North America, Europe, and East Asia were presumably eliminated as tropical climates disappeared from these areas during the Miocene.

Both sets of markers produced congruent results using parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods for a set of taxa that include outgroups (outside Cedreleae) as well as other members of the related genera within Cedreleae. All results confirm current delimitation of Cedreleae and genetic distinctiveness for four new species with divergent morphologies. Our study also provides evidence that there are several genetic entities among the accessions of C. odorata that have distinct ranges or habitat preferences. These entities may constitute new species, are morphologically cryptic and require a great deal more investigation to delimit their ranges.

	abstract = {Tropical rainforest hyperdiversity is often suggested to have evolved over a long time-span (the 'museum' model), but there is also evidence for recent rainforest radiations. The mahoganies (Meliaceae) are a prominent plant group in lowland tropical rainforests world-wide but also occur in all other tropical ecosystems. We investigated whether rainforest diversity in Meliaceae has accumulated over a long time or has more recently evolved. We inferred the largest time-calibrated phylogeny for the family to date, reconstructed ancestral states for habitat and deciduousness, estimated diversification rates and modeled potential shifts in macro-evolutionary processes using a recently developed Bayesian method. The ancestral Meliaceae is reconstructed as a deciduous species that inhabited seasonal habitats. Rainforest clades have diversified from the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene onwards. Two contemporaneous Amazonian clades have converged on similar ecologies and high speciation rates. Most species-level diversity of Meliaceae in rainforest is recent. Other studies have found steady accumulation of lineages, but the large majority of plant species diversity in rainforests is recent, suggesting (episodic) species turnover. Rainforest hyperdiversity may best be explained by recent radiations from a large stock of higher level taxa.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY Climatic and geological changes have been considered as major drivers of biological diversification. However, it has been generally assumed that lineages retain common environmental affinities, suggesting a limited capacity to switch their climatic niche. We tested this assumption with a study of the evolution of climatic niches in the Neotropical tree genus Cedrela (Meliaceae). • METHODS We combined distribution models of extant Cedrela with a dated molecular phylogeny based on one nuclear (ITS) and three plastid markers (psbA-trnH, trnS-G and psbB-T-N) to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of climatic niches. We calculated relative disparity of climatic tolerances over time to test for niche evolution within subclades or divergence between subclades and conservatism among closely related groups. Published fossil records and studies on paleosols were evaluated for the distribution and climatic conditions of extinct Cedrela. • KEY RESULTS The fossil record of Cedrela suggested a major biome shift from paratropical conditions into warm-temperate seasonal climates in the Early Oligocene of western North America. In the Miocene, Cedrela extended from North America (John Day Formation, Oregon, USA) to southern Central America (Gatún, Panama). Diversification in the early evolutionary history was mainly driven by changes in precipitation. Temperature had an increasing impact on ecological diversification of the genus from the Miocene onwards. Sister-species comparisons revealed that recent speciation events may be related to divergence of climatic tolerances. • CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights the complexity of climatic niche dynamics, and shows how conservatism and evolution have acted on different temporal scales and climatic parameters in Cedrela.},

Our analyses were set both in maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks, which (1) supported paraphyly of Aglaia and Aphanamixis; (2) demonstrated polyphyly of previously described sections for Aglaia; and (3) suggested delimitation problems with 57\% of the morphologically "variable species" and all "complex species". In general, there were more genetic entities than species described, which shows that the taxonomy of this group is more complex than has sometimes been previously assumed. For some species, morphological variation suggests the existence of more variants, subspecies or species within various taxa. Furthermore, our study detected additional phylogenetic entities that were geographically distinct, occurring on either side of Wallace's Line but not on both sides. The delineation of these inter-specific taxa needs further investigation by taking into account the morphological variation within and between populations across the entire distribution.},

The development of an integrated approach, which utilizes several different types of markers (both morphological and molecular), would be extremely useful in this context.

We adopted a population genetics approach, sampling numerous individuals from three locations where sympatric Carapa species are known to exist. Comparisons between morphological markers (the presence or absence of characters, leaf-shape traits) and molecular markers (chloroplast sequences, ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequences, and nuclear microsatellites) demonstrated the following: (i) a strong correlation between morphological and nuclear markers; (ii) despite substantial polymorphism, the inability of chloroplast DNA to discriminate between species, suggesting that cytoplasmic markers represent ineffective DNA barcodes; (iii) lineage sorting effects when using ITS sequences; and (iv) a complex evolutionary history within the genus Carapa, which includes frequent inter-specific gene flow. Our results support the use of a population genetics approach, based on ultra-polymorphic markers, to address species delimitation within complex taxonomic groups.},

	abstract = {A new biogeographic scenario for Melastomataceae (Morley and Dick, American Journal of Botany 90(11) pp. 1638-1645, 2003) accepts an ndhF-based phylogeny for the family by Renner et al. (American Journal of Botany 88(7): 1290-1300, 2001), but rejects those authors' divergence time estimates. Morley and Dick concluded that Gondwanan vicariance, rather than the more recent long dispersal proposed by Renner et al. explains the presence of the family in Africa and Madagascar. To assess the strength of this conclusion, a Bayesian analysis was conducted on three times the amount of sequence data used before (ndhF, rbcL, rpl16; 3100 base pairs [bp], excluding all gaps). The Bayesian approach to divergence time estimation does not rely on a strict molecular clock and employs multiple simultaneous minimal or maximal bounds on node ages. Reliance on northern mid-latitude fossils of Melastomataceae for calibrations was avoided or reduced by using alternative fossil and tectonic calibrations, including all those suggested by Morley and Dick. Results reaffirm the relatively recent spread of melastome lineages among the southern continents and refute the breakup of Gondwana as a plausible explanation for the presence of Dissochaeteae/Sonerileae in Madagascar and Africa and the presence of Melastomeae in Africa and Southeast Asia. Melastomeae appear to have reached Africa around 17-15 million years (my) ago, while Dissochaeteae and Sonerileae apparently reached Madagascar at 17-15 and 20-18 my ago. I also explored the effects of constraining Melastomeae to minimally 76 my old (to have reached Africa by island hopping as postulated by Morley and Dick). This resulted in an estimate for their arrival in Africa of 35 my ago and for Dissochaeteae and Sonerileae in Madagascar of 28 and 33 my ago, still implying long-distance dispersal. The Bayesian 95\% credibility ranges around these dates, however, are large. Regardless of the increasing sophistication of molecular estimates of divergence time, Gondwanan scenarios will remain untestable as long as biases in the fossil record can justifiably be invoked to explain away the absence of fossils.},

In earlier studies, some attempts have been made to infer the relationships within Leandra s.str., but the sampling was sparse and the resolution low inside the clade. Here, we attempt to provide an improved phylogenetic hypothesis for this group on which to base further studies. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive taxon sampling and attempt to infer a species tree for this group, dissecting potential noise in the phylogenetic reconstruction, such as paralogy, rogue taxa, hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. Our data set includes 126 ingroup species (192 terminals) and four partitions (six markers). We implement the (∗)BEAST model for species tree inference and perform several simulation methods to assess model fit and to discuss potential causes for the observed patterns. Major lineages of Leandra s.str. were delineated, a strictly bifurcating species tree model seems to not account for the observed data, and hybridization is very likely an important evolutionary force in this group.},

	abstract = {In a recent analysis of the historical biogeography of Melastomataceae, Renner, Clausing, and Meyer (2001; American Journal of Botany 88(7): 1290-1300) rejected the hypothesis of a Gondwana origin. Using a fossil-calibrated chloroplast DNA (ndhF) phylogeny, they placed the early diversification of Melastomataceae in Laurasia at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (ca. 55 Ma) and suggested that long-distance oceanic dispersals in the Oligocene and Miocene (34 to 5 Ma) account for its range expansion into South America, Africa, and Madagascar. Their critical assumption-that oldest northern mid-latitude melastome fossils reflect tribal ages and their geographic origins-may be erroneous, however, because of the sparse fossil record in the tropics. We show that rates of synonymous nucleotide substitutions derived by the Renner et al. (2001) model are up to three times faster than most published rates. Under a Gondwana-origin model advocated here, which includes dispersals from Africa to Southeast Asia via the "Indian ark" and emphasizes filter rather than either sweepstakes dispersal or strict vicariance, rates of nucleotide substitution fall within the range of published rates. We suggest that biogeographic reconstructions need to consider the paucity of Gondwanan fossils and that frequently overlooked interplate dispersal routes provide alternatives to vicariance, boreotropical dispersal, and long-distance oceanic dispersal as explanations for the amphi-oceanic disjunctions of many tropical rain forest plants.},

	abstract = {Conostegia has been traditionally defined to consist of 42 species in the tribe Miconieae. Recent phylogenetic studies have cast doubt on the monophyly of the genus and highlighted the need for a phylogenetic study focused on Conostegia. The purpose of this study was to test the monophyly of Conostegia and address relationships in the genus. We addressed the evolutionary history of Conostegia using DNA sequences from six loci. Difficulty in finding discrete characters that support clades prompted an anatomical survey of leaves and flowers as well as the exploratory use of some continuous characters. We coded as many species as possible for fifteen characters. Lastly, field work was conducted to document floral traits at anthesis due to the poor quality of preservation of flowers on herbarium specimens. Conostegia was found to be paraphyletic and composed of three main clades. The historically important characters of a calyptrate calyx and pleiostemony were found to have evolved more than once inside the Conostegia clade. Several other characters were found to support the clades we identified. The most unusual characters were mucilage inside the ovary which is here reported in the Melastomataceae for the first time, a stele inside the style which is mostly restricted to one clade of Conostegia and known only in this clade of the Melastomataceae, and herkogamy which has been lost in two clades within Conostegia. A combination of molecular phylogenetic analyses and broad morphological surveys allowed the better understanding of the evolutionary history in a clade of mostly cloud forest Neotropical trees. The need to include anatomical studies and tackle continuous characters is here demonstrated.},

	abstract = {The members of tribe Microlicieae in the flowering plant family Melastomataceae are nearly all endemic to the cerrado biome of Brazil. Traditional classifications of the Melastomataceae have attributed between 15 and 17 genera to the Microlicieae, but subsequent revisions have circumscribed the tribe more narrowly. The monophyly and intergeneric relationships of the Microlicieae were evaluated through phylogenetic analyses with molecular and morphological data sets. Incorporation of DNA sequences from the intron of the chloroplast gene rpl16 into a previously generated family-wide data set yielded a clade comprising Chaetostoma, Lavoisiera, Microlicia, Rhynchanthera, Stenodon, and Trembleya ("core Microlicieae"), with Rhynchanthera as the first-diverging lineage. The other four genera of Microlicieae sampled are placed in other clades: Eriocnema with Miconieae; Siphanthera with Aciotis, Nepsera, and Acisanthera of Melastomeae; Castratella as sister to Monochaetum of Melastomeae; and Cambessedesia as part of an unresolved polytomy in a large clade that includes most Melastomataceae. Analyses of the chloroplast genes rbcL and ndhF that included three core genera produced similar results, as did the combined analysis of all three data sets. Combined parsimony analyses of DNA sequences from rpl16 and the nuclear ribosomal intercistronic transcribed spacer (ITS) region of 22 species of core Microlicieae yielded generally low internal support values. Lavoisiera, recently redefined on the basis of several morphological characters, was strongly supported as monophyletic. A morphological phylogenetic analysis of the Microlicieae based on 10 parsimony-informative characters recovered a monophyletic core Microlicieae but provided no further resolution among genera. Penalized likelihood analysis with two calibration time windows produced an age estimate of 3.7 million years for the time of initial divergence of strictly Brazilian core Microlicieae. This date is in general agreement with the estimated age of the most active stage of development of cerrado vegetation and implies an adaptive shift from hydric to seasonally dry habitats during the early evolution of this group.},

Species delimitations, often based on tepal morphology, have been problematic. Our analyses of ITS sequence data for all 27 species and infraspecific taxa support recognition of two new species and recircumscription and placement of elements of the polyphyletic S. ghiesbreghtii and S. mortonii complexes. For taxa with adequate sampling, our data also indicate 11-12 cladospecies and 3-6 metaspecies according to the apomorphic species concept. The resolved phylogeny, correlated with geography and morphology, allows insight into biogeographical diversification and the evolution of some unusual morphological characters within the genus, such as nectary differentiation and tepal margin type.},

Phylogenetically based statistical methods were applied to infer ancestral character reconstructions of chromosome numbers and nuclear DNA contents. • Melanthiaceae are the most diverse family in terms of genome size, with C-values ranging more than 230-fold. Our data confirmed that giant genomes are restricted to tribe Parideae, with most extant species in the family characterized by small genomes. Ancestral genome size reconstruction revealed that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the family had a relatively small genome (1C = 5.37 pg). Chromosome losses and polyploidy are recovered as the main evolutionary mechanisms generating chromosome number change. • Genome evolution in Melanthiaceae has been characterized by a trend towards genome size reduction, with just one episode of dramatic DNA accumulation in Parideae. Such extreme contrasting profiles of genome size evolution illustrate the key role of transposable elements and chromosome rearrangements in driving the evolution of plant genomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Paris (Melanthiaceae) is a temperate genus of about 24 perennial herbaceous species distributed from Europe to eastern Asia. The delimitation of the genus and its subdivisions are unresolved questions in the taxonomy of Paris. The objective of this study is to test the generic and infrageneric circumscription of Paris with DNA sequence data. METHODS Phylogenetic analysis of 21 species of Paris based on nuclear ITS and plastid psbA-trnH and trnL-trnF DNA sequence data, alone and in combination, was employed to assess previous classifications. KEY RESULTS Paris is monophyletic in all analyses. Neither of the two traditionally recognized subgenera (Paris and Daiswa) are monophyletic. Sections Axiparis, Kinugasa, Paris and Thibeticae are monophyletic in only some of the analyses. Species of sections Dunnianae, Fargesianae and Marmoratae are consistently intercalated among species of section Euthyra in all analyses. Strong discordance between nuclear and plastid lineages is detected. CONCLUSIONS The data support the classification of Paris as a single genus rather than as three genera (Daiswa, Kinugasa and Paris sensu stricto). They provide justification for the transfer of section Axiparis from subgenus Paris to subgenus Daiswa and for the combination of sections Dunnianae, Fargesianae and Marmoratae into section Euthyra. The nuclear-plastid discordance is interpreted as the result of interspecific hybridization among sympatric species.},

	abstract = {Closely related outgroups are optimal for rooting phylogenetic trees; however, such ideal outgroups are not always available. A phylogeny of the marattioid ferns (Marattiaceae), an ancient lineage with no close relatives, was reconstructed using nucleotide sequences of multiple chloroplast regions (rps4 + rps4-trnS spacer, trnS-trnG spacer + trnG intron, rbcL, atpB), from 88 collections, selected to cover the broadest possible range of morphologies and geographic distributions within the extant taxa. Because marattioid ferns are phylogenetically isolated from other lineages, and internal branches are relatively short, rooting was problematic. Root placement was strongly affected by long-branch attraction under maximum parsimony and by model choice under maximum likelihood. A multifaceted approach to rooting was employed to isolate the sources of bias and produce a consensus root position. In a statistical comparison of all possible root positions with three different outgroups, most root positions were not significantly less optimal than the maximum likelihood root position, including the consensus root position. This phylogeny has several important taxonomic implications for marattioid ferns: Marattia in the broad sense is paraphyletic; the Hawaiian endemic Marattia douglasii is most closely related to tropical American taxa; and Angiopteris is monophyletic only if Archangiopteris and Macroglossum are included.},

We used DNA sequence data from three plastid regions (atpB, rbcL, and trnL-F), morphological characters from both herbarium specimens and live plants observed in the field, and geographical and ecological information to examine evolutionary patterns. Eleven representatives of five other marattioid genera (Angiopteris, Archangiopteris, Christensenia, Macroglossum, and Marattia) were used to root the topology. We identified three well-supported clades within Danaea that are consistent with morphological characters: the "leprieurii" clade (containing species traditionally associated with the name D. elliptica), the "nodosa" clade (containing all species traditionally associated with the name D. nodosa), and the "alata" clade (containing all other species). All three clades are geographically and ecologically widely distributed, but subclades within them show various distribution patterns. Our phylogenetic hypothesis provides a robust framework within which broad questions related to the morphology, taxonomy, biogeography, evolution, and ecology of these ferns can be addressed.},

However, the extent of hybridization and reinforcement is little documented in the tropics. Here we explore the pattern of gene flow between three sister species from the herbaceous genus Marantochloa (Marantaceae), sympatrically distributed in the understorey of the African rainforest, using data from the chloroplast and nuclear genomes (DNA sequences and AFLP). We found highly contrasting patterns: while there was no evidence of gene flow between M. congensis and M. monophylla, species identity between M. monophylla and M. incertifolia was maintained despite considerable gene flow. We hypothesize that M. incertifolia originated from an ancient hybridization event between M. congensis and M. monophylla, considering the current absence of hybridization between the two assumed parent species, the rare presence of shared haplotypes between all three species and the high percentage of haplotypes shared by M. incertifolia with each of the two parent species. This example is contrasted with two parapatrically distributed species from the same family in the genus Haumania forming a hybrid zone restricted to the area of overlap. This work illustrates the diversity of speciation/introgression patterns that can potentially occur in the flora of tropical Africa.},

	abstract = {Calathea, with an estimated 285 species, is the largest genus of Marantaceae and an important component of Neotropical herbaceous diversity. The genus is also of high importance for horticulture as species are cultivated for their showy, patterned leaves. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies indicated that the genus is polyphyletic, but have not provided a basis for redefining generic limits due to incomplete taxon sampling. To address this problem we analyzed DNA sequence data from three plastid markers (matK with flanking 3′ trnK intron, trnL intron and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer) and one nuclear marker (ITS) under a maximum parsimony criterion for a large and representative taxon sample covering all previously proposed infrageneric entities, and representing the full range of morphological variation known in the genus. Our results confirm that Calathea is polyphyletic. One clade, including subgenus Calathea, the C. lanicaulis group, and the genus Sanblasia, is sister to a clade formed by Ischnosiphon and Pleiostachya. The genus Monotagma is placed as sister to this clade. The remaining species form a second strongly supported clade as sister to a clade containing these other genera. Based on these findings Calathea is recircumscribed in a narrow sense and Sanblasia is placed in synonymy. The genus Goeppertia is resurrected and redefined to include all members of the second Calathea clade. Morphological characters defining each genus are provided. A total of 246 new combinations are made.},

	abstract = {The domestication of both diploid and tetraploid cotton species was carried out for fiber utilization. To understand the origin and domestication of fibers, 18 genes related to fiber development were individually cloned and sequenced from 22 different cotton species. Their structures, phylogenetic relationship and molecular evolution were further studied. In the orthologous and homeologous loci of the 18 genes, the sequence and structure of 72.22\% were conserved and 27.78\% were diverse. Tree topologies constructed based on the combined sequences showed that all 13 D-genome species were congruent with Fryxell's subsection taxonomy, the A- and D-subgenomes independently evolved in the allopolyploid after polyploid formation, and Gossypium raimondii had the closest relationship with all allotetraploids of D-subgenomes. The molecular evolutionary rates revealed approximately equivalent rates among different D-genome species, and purifying selection acted on all genes in the wild D-genome species. Among orthologs and homeologs, the D-subgenomes had higher evolutionary rates than the A-subgenomes in tetraploid cotton species, and the cultivars had higher evolutionary rates than either the semi-domesticated or wild species. Our study revealed that human domestication altered the molecular evolutionary pattern of genes related to fiber development, and Gossypium hirsutum endured greater selective pressures than Gossypium barbadense during the domestication process.},

Both processes were also invoked to have had a strong impact in the evolution of Palaua, based on morphological intermediacy. Here, we used nuclear ITS and cellulose synthase DNA sequences to assess previous phylogenetic hypotheses and to uncover previously undescribed reticulate evolution in Palaua. Both nuclear regions recovered largely the same reticulate pattern, showing that interspecific crosses occurred between distantly related species of the Dissecta and Integrifolia clade. Hybridization between species occurred only in a narrow contact zone. Moreover, many sequences of Palaua dissecta were placed in the strongly divergent Integrifolia clade, a pattern that is best explained by introgression. These results support our view that the strong interannual fluctuations of humidity and habitat expansion provide opportunities for the isolation of taxa, establishment of hybrid species, and for introgression between incompletely reproductively isolated taxa following recurrent contact.},

Althaea and, in particular, Lavatera and Malva are highly polyphyletic as currently circumscribed, because their diagnostic characters, the number and degree of fusion of the epicalyx bracts, evolve in a highly homoplasious manner. In contrast, fruit morphology largely agrees with the molecularly delimited groups. Hybrid origins confirmed for the genus Malvalthaea and for Lavatera mauritanica and hybridization in the group of ruderal small-flowered mallows underline the importance of reticulate evolution in shaping the history of this group and complicating the interpretation of morphological evolution.},

	abstract = {Previous molecular phylogenetic studies have failed to resolve the branching order among the major cotton (Gossypium) lineages, and it has been unclear whether this reflects actual history (rapid radiation) or sampling properties of the genes evaluated. In this paper, we reconsider the phylogenetic relationships of diploid cotton genome groups using DNA sequences from 11 single-copy nuclear loci (10 293 base pairs [bp]), nuclear ribosomal DNA (695 bp), and four chloroplast loci (7370 bp). Results from individual loci and combined nuclear and chloroplast DNA partitions reveal that the cotton genome groups radiated in rapid succession following the formation of the genus. Maximum likelihood analysis of nuclear synonymous sites shows that this radiation occurred within a time span equivalent to 17\% of the time since the separation of Gossypium from its nearest extant relatives in the genera Kokia and Gossypioides. Chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies differ significantly with respect to resolution of the basal divergence in the genus and to interrelationships among African cottons. This incongruence is due to limited character evolution in cpDNA and either previously unsuspected hybridization or unreliable phylogenetic performance of the cpDNA characters. This study highlights the necessity of using multiple, independent data sets for resolving phylogenetic relationships of rapidly diverged lineages.},

Very low variation within each of the three groups in the sequenced regions is consistent with recent radiation of each clade. We reject the previously suggested hypothesis of monophyly for the annual species of Sidalcea. Based on our findings, the annual habit in Sidalcea arose at least four times, probably as an adaptation to seasonally dry habitats. The hypothesis that the perennial species S. hickmanii and S. malachroides represent basally divergent groups within Sidalcea is supported, but the more recently discovered S. stipularis represents an additional basally divergent lineage. The previous suggestion that the genus spread northward from Mexico along two major routes (through the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada foothills), with the Rocky Mountain species S. candida and S. neomexicana representing basally divergent lineages, is not supported. Sidalcea neomexicana is nested within the malviflora clade and is likely a lineage of relatively recent descent that originated in California and subsequently spread to the Rocky Mountains.},

Despite remarkable progress in angiosperm systematics during the last 20 y, relationships within Malpighiales remain poorly resolved, possibly owing to its rapid rise during the mid-Cretaceous. Using phylogenomic approaches, including analyses of 82 plastid genes from 58 species, we identified 12 additional clades in Malpighiales and substantially increased resolution along the backbone. This greatly improved phylogeny revealed a dynamic history of shifts in net diversification rates across Malpighiales, with bursts of diversification noted in the Barbados cherries (Malpighiaceae), cocas (Erythroxylaceae), and passion flowers (Passifloraceae). We found that commonly used a priori approaches for partitioning concatenated data in maximum likelihood analyses, by gene or by codon position, performed poorly relative to the use of partitions identified a posteriori using a Bayesian mixture model. We also found better branch support in trees inferred from a taxon-rich, data-sparse matrix, which deeply sampled only the phylogenetically critical placeholders, than in trees inferred from a taxon-sparse matrix with little missing data. Although this matrix has more missing data, our a posteriori partitioning strategy reduced the possibility of producing multiple distinct but equally optimal topologies and increased phylogenetic decisiveness, compared with the strategy of partitioning by gene.

	abstract = {The eudicot order Malpighiales contains ∼16000 species and is the most poorly resolved large rosid clade. To clarify phylogenetic relationships in the order, we used maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and parsimony analyses of DNA sequence data from 13 gene regions, totaling 15604 bp, and representing all three genomic compartments (i.e., plastid: atpB, matK, ndhF, and rbcL; mitochondrial: ccmB, cob, matR, nad1B-C, nad6, and rps3; and nuclear: 18S rDNA, PHYC, and newly developed low-copy EMB2765). Our sampling of 190 taxa includes representatives from all families of Malpighiales. These data provide greatly increased support for the recent additions of Aneulophus, Bhesa, Centroplacus, Ploiarium, and Rafflesiaceae to Malpighiales; sister relations of Phyllanthaceae + Picrodendraceae, monophyly of Hypericaceae, and polyphyly of Clusiaceae. Oxalidales + Huaceae, followed by Celastrales are successive sisters to Malpighiales. Parasitic Rafflesiaceae, which produce the world's largest flowers, are confirmed as embedded within a paraphyletic Euphorbiaceae. Novel findings show a well-supported placement of Ctenolophonaceae with Erythroxylaceae + Rhizophoraceae, sister-group relationships of Bhesa + Centroplacus, and the exclusion of Medusandra from Malpighiales. New taxonomic circumscriptions include the addition of Bhesa to Centroplacaceae, Medusandra to Peridiscaceae (Saxifragales), Calophyllaceae applied to Clusiaceae subfamily Kielmeyeroideae, Peraceae applied to Euphorbiaceae subfamily Peroideae, and Huaceae included in Oxalidales.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The clusioid clade includes five families (i.e., Bonnetiaceae, Calophyllaceae, Clusiaceae s.s., Hypericaceae, and Podostemaceae) represented by 94 genera and ≈1900 species. Species in this clade form a conspicuous element of tropical forests worldwide and are important in horticulture, timber production, and pharmacology. We conducted a taxon-rich multigene phylogenetic analysis of the clusioids to clarify phylogenetic relationships in this clade. METHODS We analyzed plastid (matK, ndhF, and rbcL) and mitochondrial (matR) nucleotide sequence data using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. Our combined data set included 194 species representing all major clusioid subclades, plus numerous species spanning the taxonomic, morphological, and biogeographic breadth of the clusioid clade. KEY RESULTS Our results indicate that Tovomita (Clusiaceae s.s.), Harungana and Hypericum (Hypericaceae), and Ledermanniella s.s. and Zeylanidium (Podostemaceae) are not monophyletic. In addition, we place four genera that have not been included in any previous molecular study: Ceratolacis, Diamantina, and Griffithella (Podostemaceae), and Santomasia (Hypericaceae). Finally, our results indicate that Lianthus, Santomasia, Thornea, and Triadenum can be safely merged into Hypericum (Hypericaceae). CONCLUSIONS We present the first well-resolved, taxon-rich phylogeny of the clusioid clade. Taxon sampling and resolution within the clade are greatly improved compared to previous studies and provide a strong basis for improving the classification of the group. In addition, our phylogeny will form the foundation for our future work investigating the biogeography of tropical angiosperms that exhibit Gondwanan distributions.},

The goals of our study were to resolve relationships among the 11 generic segregates from the New World genus Mascagnia, test the monophyly of the largest remaining Malpighiaceae genera, and clarify the placement of Old World Malpighiaceae. • METHODS We combined DNA sequence data for four genes (plastid ndhF, matK, and rbcL and nuclear PHYC) from 338 ingroup accessions that represented all 77 currently recognized genera with morphological data from 144 ingroup species to produce a complete generic phylogeny of the family. • KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The genera are distributed among 14 mostly well-supported clades. The interrelationships of these major subclades have strong support, except for the clade comprising the wing-fruited genera (i.e., the malpighioid+Amorimia, Ectopopterys, hiraeoid, stigmaphylloid, and tetrapteroid clades). These results resolve numerous systematic problems, while others have emerged and constitute opportunities for future study. Malpighiaceae migrated from the New to Old World nine times, with two of those migrants being very recent arrivals from the New World. The seven other Old World clades dispersed much earlier, likely during the Tertiary. Comparison of floral morphology in Old World Malpighiaceae with their closest New World relatives suggests that morphological stasis in the New World likely results from selection by neotropical oil-bee pollinators and that the morphological diversity found in Old World flowers has evolved following their release from selection by those bees.},

A total of 104 samples representing 86 taxa from all sections and most subsections were sequenced. Twelve major groups are well supported to be monophyletic within Magnoliaceae and these groups are largely consistent with the recent taxonomic revision at the sectional and subsectional levels. However, relationships at deeper nodes of the subfamily Magnolioideae remain not well resolved. A relaxed clock relying on uncorrelated rates suggests that the complicated divergent evolution of Magnolioideae began around the early Eocene (54.57mya), concordant with paleoclimatic and fossil evidence. Intercontinental disjunctions of Magnoliaceae in the Northern Hemisphere appear to have originated during at least two geologic periods. Some occurred after the middle Miocene, represented by two well-recognized temperate lineages disjunct between eastern Asia and eastern North America. The others may have occurred no later than the Oligocene, with ancient separations between or within tropical and temperate lineages.},

The results show that much extant species diversity in Lycopodiaceae stems from relatively recent cladogenic events. These results corroborate previous ideas based on paleobotanical and biogeographical data. Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses recognized a split into neotropical and paleotropical clades in Huperzia, which contains 85-90\% of all living species. Connecting this biogeographical pattern with continent movements, the diversification of this epiphytic group was suggested to coincide with that of angiosperms in the mid to Late Cretaceous. Results presented here are consistent with this idea, and the diversification of the two clades is resolved as Late Cretacous (78 and 95 Myr). In the related genera Lycopodium and Lycopodiella, the patterns are somewhat different. Here species diversity is scattered among different subgeneric groups. Most of the high-diversity subgeneric groups seem to have diversified very recently (Late Tertiary), whereas the cladogenic events leading to these groups are much older (Early to Late Cretaceous). Our analysis shows that, although much living species diversity stems from relatively recent cladogenesis, the origins of the family (Early Carboniferous) and generic crown groups (Early Permian to Early Jurassic) are much more ancient events.},

	abstract = {The generic classification of huperzioid Lycopodiaceae was tested using Bayesian inference and Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from four chloroplast loci for 119 taxa and optimisation of 29 morphological characteristics onto the phylogeny. Consistent with previous studies, the subfamilies Lycopodioideae and Huperzioideae are monophyletic and diagnosable by synapomorphies that correlate with differences in their life-histories. Within the Huperzioideae, the monophyly of the widely adopted genus Huperzia (excl. Phylloglossum) is poorly supported. Three clades of huperzioid Lycopodiaceae were recovered in all analyses of molecular data: Phylloglossum drummondii, Huperzia sensu stricto and Phlegmariurus sensu lato. These clades are strongly supported by morphological characters, including differences in spores, gametophytes, sporophyte macro-morphology, as well as growth habit and life-histories. Our findings indicate that either a one-genus (Huperzia s.l.) or a three-genus (Phylloglossum, Huperzia s.s. and Phlegmariurus s.l.) classification of huperzioid Lycopods are equally supported by molecular evidence, but a two-genus system (Huperzia s.l.+Phylloglossum) is not. We recommend recognising three genera in the huperzioid Lycopodiaceae, as this classification best reflects evolutionary, ecological, and morphological divergence within the lineage.},

	abstract = {Loranthaceae (73 genera and ca. 900 species) comprise mostly aerial hemiparasitic plants. Three monotypic genera considered relicts are root parasites. The family is diverse in tropical areas, but representatives are also found in temperate habitats. Previous classifications were based on floral and inflorescence morphology, karyological information, and biogeography. The family has been divided into three tribes: Nuytsiae, Elytrantheae (subtribes Elytranthinae and Gaiadendrinae), and Lorantheae (subtribes Loranthinae and Psittacanthinae). Nuytsiae and Elytrantheae are characterized by a base chromosome number of x = 12, whereas subtribes Loranthinae (x = 9) and Psittacanthinae (x = 8) numbers are derived via aneuploid reduction. To elucidate the phylogeny of the family, we analyzed sequences from five genes (nuclear small and large subunit rDNA and the chloroplast genes rbcL, matK, and trnL-F) representing most genera using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian inference. The three root parasites, Nuytsia, Atkinsonia, and Gaiadendron, are supported as successive sister taxa to the remaining genera, resulting in a monophyletic group of aerial parasites. Three major clades are resolved each corresponding to a subtribe. However, two South American genera (Tristerix and Notanthera) and the New Zealand genus Tupeia, which were previously classified in subtribe Elytranthinae, are weakly supported as part of a clade representing the South American subtribe Psittacanthinae.},

Here we used Loranthaceae, a speciose and ecologically important mistletoe family, to obtain new insights into the interrelationships among its hosts and dispersers. Phylogenetic analyses of Loranthaceae were based on a dataset of nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences. Divergence time estimation, ancestral area reconstruction, and diversification rate analyses were employed to examine historical biogeography. The crown group of Loranthaceae was estimated to originate in Australasian Gondwana during the Paleocene to early Eocene (59 Ma, 95\% HPD: 53-66 Ma), and rapidly diversified, converting from root parasitic to aerial parasitic trophic mode ca. 50 Ma during the Eocene climatic optimum. Subsequently, Loranthaceae were inferred to be widespread in Australasia and South America but absent in Africa. The African and European members were derived from Asiatic lineages. The burst of diversification of Loranthaceae occurred during a climatic optimum period that coincides with the dominance of tropical forests in the world. This also corresponds to the trophic mode conversion of Loranthaceae and rapid radiation of many bird families - important agents for long-distance dispersal in the Cenozoic.},

A recent genetic study challenged the monophyly of Logania, suggesting that its two sections, Logania sect. Logania and Logania sect. Stomandra, do not group together. Additionally, the genus has a disjunct distribution, with a gap at the Nullarbor Plain in southern Australia. Therefore, Logania is a favourable candidate to gain insight into phylogenetic relationships and how these might intersect with Earth-history events. Our phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences of two chloroplast markers (petD and rps16) showed that Logania sect. Logania and L. sect. Stomandra were each resolved as monophyletic, but the genus (as currently circumscribed) was not. Based on our Bayesian estimates of divergence times, the disjunct distributions within Logania sect. Stomandra could have been caused by flooding of the Eucla Basin. However, this biogeographical process cannot account for the distribution of Logania sect.

However, the conditions that favor the origination and persistence of polyploids are still not well understood. Here, we examine origins of 16 polyploid species in Mentzelia section Trachyphytum. • METHODS We used phylogeny reconstructions based on DNA sequences from plastid regions and the nuclear gene isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh) to construct hypotheses of introgression and polyploidization. • KEY RESULTS Molecular data suggest that homoploid hybridization has been surprisingly common in Trachyphytum. Diploid species had unequal involvement in polyploid origins, but most polyploid taxa had allopolyploid origins from extant progenitors. A few polyploids with extreme phenotypes did not appear to have extant progenitors. We infer that the progenitors of these species were derived from extinct diploid lineages or ancestral lineages of multiple extant diploids. In agreement with other recent studies, we recovered molecular evidence of multiple phylogenetically distinct origins for several polyploid taxa, including the widespread octoploid M. albicaulis. • CONCLUSIONS Evidence of high levels of introgression and allopolyploidy suggests that hybridization has played an important role in the evolution of Trachyphytum. Although idh sequences exhibited complicated evolution, including gene duplication, deletion, and recombination, they provided a higher percentage of informative characters for phylogeny reconstruction than the most variable plastid regions, allowing tests of hypotheses regarding polyploid origins. Given the necessity for rapidly evolving low-copy nuclear genes, researchers studying hybridization and polyploidy may increasingly turn to complex sequence data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND In the large angiosperm order Lamiales, a diverse array of highly specialized life strategies such as carnivory, parasitism, epiphytism, and desiccation tolerance occur, and some lineages possess drastically accelerated DNA substitutional rates or miniaturized genomes. However, understanding the evolution of these phenomena in the order, and clarifying borders of and relationships among lamialean families, has been hindered by largely unresolved trees in the past. RESULTS Our analysis of the rapidly evolving trnK/matK, trnL-F and rps16 chloroplast regions enabled us to infer more precise phylogenetic hypotheses for the Lamiales. Relationships among the nine first-branching families in the Lamiales tree are now resolved with very strong support. Subsequent to Plocospermataceae, a clade consisting of Carlemanniaceae plus Oleaceae branches, followed by Tetrachondraceae and a newly inferred clade composed of Gesneriaceae plus Calceolariaceae, which is also supported by morphological characters. Plantaginaceae (incl. Gratioleae) and Scrophulariaceae are well separated in the backbone grade; Lamiaceae and Verbenaceae appear in distant clades, while the recently described Linderniaceae are confirmed to be monophyletic and in an isolated position. CONCLUSIONS Confidence about deep nodes of the Lamiales tree is an important step towards understanding the evolutionary diversification of a major clade of flowering plants. The degree of resolution obtained here now provides a first opportunity to discuss the evolution of morphological and biochemical traits in Lamiales. The multiple independent evolution of the carnivorous syndrome, once in Lentibulariaceae and a second time in Byblidaceae, is strongly supported by all analyses and topological tests. The evolution of selected morphological characters such as flower symmetry is discussed. The addition of further sequence data from introns and spacers holds promise to eventually obtain a fully resolved plastid tree of Lamiales.},

	abstract = {The Lamiales are one of the largest orders of angiosperms, with about 22,000 species. The Scrophulariaceae, as one of their most important families, has recently been shown to be polyphyletic. As a consequence, this family was re-classified and several groups of former scrophulariaceous genera now belong to different families, such as the Calceolariaceae, Plantaginaceae, or Phrymaceae. In the present study, relationships of the genera Craterostigma, Lindernia and its allies, hitherto classified within the Scrophulariaceae, were analyzed. Sequences of the chloroplast trnK intron and the matK gene (approximately 2.5 kb) were generated for representatives of all major lineages of the Lamiales and the former Scrophulariaceae. Bayesian and parsimony analyses revealed two isolated lineages, one of which consists of Lindernia and its allies, the other of Gratiola and allies. Gratiola was previously assumed to be related to Lindernia and was therefore included here. It is proposed to treat the two clades as separate families, Linderniaceae and Gratiolaceae. For the Linderniaceae, several morphological synapomorphies exist in addition to molecular data, such as conspicuous club-shaped stamen appendages.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Cultivated flax (Linum usitatissimum) is known to have undergone a whole-genome duplication around 5-9 million years ago. The aim of this study was to investigate whether other whole-genome duplication events have occurred in the evolutionary history of cultivated flax. Knowledge of such whole-genome duplications will be important in understanding the biology and genomics of cultivated flax. METHODS Transcriptomes of 11 Linum species were sequenced using the Illumina platform. The short reads were assembled de novo and the DupPipe pipeline was used to look for signatures of polyploidy events from the age distribution of paralogues. In addition, phylogenies of all paralogues were assembled within an estimated age window of interest. These phylogenies were assessed for evidence of a paleopolyploidy event within the genus Linum. KEY RESULTS A previously unknown paleopolyploidy event that occurred 20-40 million years ago was discovered and shown to be specific to a clade within Linum containing cultivated flax (L. usitatissimum) and other mainly blue-flowered species. The finding was supported by two lines of evidence. First, a significant change of slope (peak) was shown in the age distribution of paralogues that was phylogenetically restricted to, and ubiquitous in, this clade. Second, a large number of paralogue phylogenies were retrieved that are consistent with a polyploidy event occurring within that clade. CONCLUSIONS The results show the utility of multi-species transcriptomics for detecting whole-genome duplication events and demonstrate that that multiple rounds of polyploidy have been important in shaping the evolutionary history of flax. Understanding and characterizing these whole-genome duplication events will be important for future Linum research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Gagea is a Eurasian genus of petaloid monocots, with a few species in North Africa, comprising between 70 and approximately 275 species depending on the author. Lloydia (thought to be the closest relative of Gagea) consists of 12-20 species that have a mostly eastern Asian distribution. Delimitation of these genera and their subdivisions are unresolved questions in Liliaceae taxonomy. The objective of this study is to evaluate generic and infrageneric circumscription of Gagea and Lloydia using DNA sequence data. METHODS A phylogenetic study of Gagea and Lloydia (Liliaceae) was conducted using sequences of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid (rpl16 intron, trnL intron, trnL-F spacer, matK and the psbA-trnH spacer) DNA regions. This included 149 accessions (seven as outgroups), with multiple accessions of some taxa; 552 sequences were included, of which 393 were generated as part of this research. KEY RESULTS A close relationship of Gagea and Lloydia was confirmed in analyses using different datasets, but neither Gagea nor Lloydia forms a monophyletic group as currently circumscribed; however, the ITS and plastid analyses did not produce congruent results for the placement of Lloydia relative to the major groups within Gagea. Gagea accessions formed five moderately to strongly supported clades in all trees, with most Lloydia taxa positioned at the basal nodes; in the strict consensus trees from the combined data a basal polytomy occurs. There is limited congruence between the classical, morphology-derived infrageneric taxonomy in Gagea (including Lloydia) and clades in the present phylogenetic analyses. CONCLUSIONS The analyses support monophyly of Gagea/Lloydia collectively, and they clearly comprise a single lineage, as some previous authors have hypothesized. The results provide the basis for a new classification of Gagea that has support from some morphological features. Incongruence between plastid and nuclear ITS results is interpreted as potentially due to ancient hybridization and/or paralogy of ITS rDNA.},

	abstract = {The Hengduan Mountains (H-D Mountains) in China flank the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Q-T Plateau) and are a center of great temperate plant diversity. The geological history and complex topography of these mountains may have prompted the in situ evolution of many diverse and narrowly endemic species. Despite the importance of the H-D Mountains to biodiversity, many uncertainties remain regarding the timing and tempo of their uplift. One hypothesis is that the Q-T Plateau underwent a final, rapid phase of uplift 8-7 million years ago (Mya) and that the H-D Mountains orogeny was a separate event occurring 4-3 Mya. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed phylogenetic, biogeographic, divergence time dating, and diversification rate analyses of the horticulturally important genus Lilium, including Nomocharis. The Lilium-Nomocharis complex is distributed throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere but is most diverse within the H-D Mountains and Q-T Plateau. Our matK and ITS phylogenies support previous studies showing that Nomocharis is nested within Lilium. However, we detected incongruence between the two gene trees which may result from hybridization. Dating analyses performed using the ITS dataset showed that the evolution of major lineages within Lilium-Nomocharis may be temporally coincident with Q-T Plateau uplift occurring 8-7 Mya and H-D Mountains uplift approximately 4-3 Mya. Our analyses of diversification times and rates among Lilium-Nomocharis clades are less conclusive. However, these do suggest high extinction rates among H-D Mountains lineages.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Several previous studies have shown that some morphologically distinctive, small genera of vascular plants that are endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and adjacent Hengduan Mountains appear to have unexpected and complex phylogenetic relationships with their putative sisters, which are typically more widespread and more species rich. In particular, the endemic genera may form one or more poorly resolved paraphyletic clades within the sister group despite distinctive morphology. Plausible explanations for this evolutionary and biogeographic pattern include extreme habitat specialization and hybridization. One genus consistent with this pattern is Nomocharis Franchet. Nomocharis comprises 7-15 species bearing showy-flowers that are endemic to the H-D Mountains. Nomocharis has long been treated as sister to Lilium L., which is comprised of more than 120 species distributed throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Although Nomocharis appears morphologically distinctive, recent molecular studies have shown that it is nested within Lilium, from which is exhibits very little sequence divergence. In this study, we have used a dated molecular phylogenetic framework to gain insight into the timing of morphological and ecological divergence in Lilium-Nomocharis and to preliminarily explore possible hybridization events. We accomplished our objectives using dated phylogenies reconstructed from nuclear internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and six chloroplast markers. RESULTS Our phylogenetic reconstruction revealed several Lilium species nested within a clade of Nomocharis, which evolved ca. 12 million years ago and is itself nested within the rest of Lilium. Flat/open and horizon oriented flowers are ancestral in Nomocharis. Species of Lilium nested within Nomocharis diverged from Nomocharis ca. 6.5 million years ago. These Lilium evolved recurved and campanifolium flowers as well as the nodding habit by at least 3.5 million years ago. Nomocharis and the nested Lilium species had relatively low elevation ancestors ({\textless}1000 m) and underwent diversification into new, higher elevational habitats 3.5 and 5.5 million years ago, respectively. Our phylogeny reveals signatures of hybridization including incongruence between the plastid and nuclear gene trees, geographic clustering of the maternal (i.e., plastid) lineages, and divergence ages of the nuclear gene trees consistent with speciation and secondary contact, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The timing of speciation and ecological and morphological evolutionary events in Nomocharis are temporally consistent with uplift in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and of the Hengduan Mountains 7 and 3-4 million years ago, respectively. Thus, we speculate that the mountain building may have provided new habitats that led to specialization of morphological and ecological features in Nomocharis and the nested Lilium along ecological gradients. Additionally, we suspect that the mountain building may have led to secondary contact events that enabled hybridization in Lilium-Nomocharis. Both the habitat specialization and hybridization have probably played a role in generating the striking morphological differences between Lilium and Nomocharis.},

	abstract = {Fritillaria (Liliaceae) is a genus of approximately 140 species of bulbous perennial plants that includes taxa of both horticultural and medicinal importance. As well as being commercially valuable, Fritillaria species have attracted attention because of their exceptionally large genome sizes, with all values recorded to date in excess of 30Gb. Despite such interest in the genus, phylogenetic relationships between the majority of species have remained untested. Here we present the first phylogenetic reconstruction of relationships to encompass most of the currently recognised species diversity in the genus. Three regions of the plastid genome were sequenced in 117 individuals of Fritillaria, representing 92 species (c. 66\% of the genus) and in representatives of nine other genera of Liliaceae. Eleven low-copy nuclear gene regions were also screened in selected species for their potential utility. Phylogenetic analysis of a combined plastid dataset using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference provided support for the monophyly of the majority of currently recognised subgenera. However, subgenus Fritillaria, which is by far the largest of the subgenera and includes the most important species used in traditional Chinese medicine, is found to be polyphyletic. Moreover, several taxa that were represented by multiple individuals show evidence of species non-monophyly. The Japanese endemic subgenus Japonica, which contains the species with the largest recorded genome size for any diploid plant, is resolved as sister to the predominantly Middle Eastern and Central Asian subgenus Rhinopetalum. Whilst relationships between most of the major Fritillaria lineages can now be resolved, our results also highlight the need for data from additional independently evolving loci; an endeavour that may be particularly challenging in light of the huge nuclear genomes found in these plants.},

	abstract = {Four Erythronium species have been traditionally recognised within Eurasia based on their disjunct distributions and the slight morphological divergence between them: E. dens-canis, E. caucasicum, E. sibiricum and E. japonicum. The range of E. sibiricum includes adjacent parts of southern Siberia, Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia in the Altai-Sayan mountain region. Despite several recently proposed taxa within the range of E. sibiricum (E. sajanense, E. sibiricum subsp. altaicum, E. sibiricum subsp. sulevii), this species has never been tested for genetic subdivisions. We here used nucleotide sequence variation in one nuclear (internal transcribed spacer) and two plastid (rpl32-trnL, rps15-ycf1) regions to test for genetic divisions within Siberian Erythronium and, in particular, to examine the phylogenetic position of E. sajanense. The plastid phylogeny revealed a basal polytomy among E. japonicum, E. sibiricum populations pertaining to E. sajanense and a third strongly supported lineage that includes E. dens-canis, E. caucasicum and the remainder of E. sibiricum, thus rendering Siberian Erythronium non-monophyletic. The nuclear topology agrees with the plastid one in recovering E. sajanense as a distinct lineage that is weakly supported as sister to E. japonicum. Topological incongruences exist between the plastid and nuclear phylogenies but these do not affect the taxonomic recognition of E. sajanense (endemic to the Western Sayan Mts.). This species is morphologically distinguishable on the basis of its subulate stamen filaments. Whereas nuclear phylogeny failed to resolve any genetic grouping within E. sibiricum s. str., plastid data recovered a deep (possibly phylogeographically meaningful) lineage from samples referred to as E. sibiricum subsp. altaicum.},

Studies using various molecular markers have established that Lentibulariaceae and their three genera are monophyletic with Pinguicula being sister to a Genlisea-Utricularia-clade, while the closest relatives of the family remain uncertain. Character states of the carnivorous syndrome in related proto-carnivorous lamialean families apparently emerged independently. In Utricularia, the terrestrial habit has been reconstructed as plesiomorphic, and an extension of subgenus Polypompholyx is warranted. In the protozoan-attracting Genlisea, subgenus Tayloria is revealed as basal lineage. In Pinguicula, the six major lineages found reflect radiations in clearly defined geographic regions, whereas most previously recognized subgeneric taxa are non-monophyletic. Genlisea and Utricularia exhibit substitutional rates that rank among the highest in angiosperms for the molecular markers analyzed. One possible explanation for this lies in selective constraints on a wide range of genomic regions that may have been lowered due to the use of an alternative mode of acquiring nutrients.},

The further evolution of various morphological characters during the diversification of the genus is discussed. The two previously suggested subgenera Tayloria and Genlisea correspond to the two major clades found in our analyses.

	abstract = {The Lecythidaceae comprise a pantropical family best known for the edible seeds of the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and the cannon-ball tree (Couroupita guianensis), which is planted as a botanical curiosity in subtropical and tropical gardens. In addition, species of the family are often among the most common in neotropical forests, especially in the Amazon Basin. The Brazil nut family is diverse and abundant in the Amazon and is considered to be an indicator of undisturbed or scarcely disturbed lowland forests; thus, what is learned about its evolution, ecology, and biogeography may suggest similar patterns for other Amazonian tree families. We used combined data sets derived from the ndhF and trnL-F genes to elucidate relationships of genera in both the Old and New Worlds that have been associated with Lecythidaceae. Our molecular tree agrees with the recognition of Napoleonaeaceae and Scytopetalaceae. Within the Lecythidaceae, there is molecular support for recognizing three subfamilies: Foetidioideae, Planchonioideae, and Lecythidoideae. We then focused on genera of the Lecythidoideae and found support for recognizing Allantoma (when the actinomorphic-flowered species of Cariniana are included in it), Grias, Gustavia, Corythophora, Couratari, and Couroupita, but conclude that Cariniana, Lecythis, and Eschweilera are not monoyphyletic. Because the position of the monotypic Bertholletia excelsa in relation to the other zygomorphic-flowered genera is not resolved, we are not able to comment on its generic relationships.},

The relationships within the group are still controversial, and its intercontinental disjunction has not been investigated with extensive sampling and precise time dating. • METHODS ITS and LEAFY intron II sequences of 78 Persea group species and nine other Lauraceae species were analyzed with maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Divergence time estimation employed Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method under a relaxed clock. • KEY RESULTS Several traditional genera or subgenera within the Persea group form well-supported monophyletic groups except Alseodaphne and Dehaasia. The divergence time of the Persea group is estimated as ∼55.3 (95\% higher posterior densities [HPD] 41.4-69.9) million years ago (mya). Two major divergences within the Persea group are estimated as ∼51.9 (95\% HPD 38.9-63.9) mya and ∼48.5 (95\% HPD 35.9-59.9) mya. • CONCLUSIONS Persea can be retained as a genus by the inclusion of Apollonias barbujana and exclusion a few species that do not fit into the established subgenera. A major revision is recommended for the delimitation between Alseodaphne, Dehaasia, and Nothaphoebe. We suggest that the Persea group originated from the Perseeae-Laureae radiation in early Eocene Laurasia. Its amphi-pacific disjunction results from the disruption of boreotropical flora by climatic cooling during the mid- to late Eocene. The American-Macaronesian disjunction may be explained by the long-distance dispersal.},

Here we use the fossil-rich Cinnamomum group, a primarily tropical and subtropical Asian lineage with some species distributed in Neotropics, Australasia and Africa to shed light upon this disjunction pattern. Phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses were carried out using sequences of three nuclear loci from 94 Cinnamomum group and 13 outgroup samples. Results show that although there are three clades within a monophyletic Cinnamomum group, Cinnamomum and previously recognized subdivisions within this genus were all rejected as natural groups. The Cinnamomum group appears to have originated in the widespread boreotropical paleoflora of Laurasia during the early Eocene (ca. 55Ma). The formation and breakup of the boreotropics seems to have then played a key role in the formation of intercontinental disjunctions within the Cinnamomum group. The first cooling interval (50-48Ma) in the late early Eocene resulted in a floristic discontinuity between Eurasia and North America causing the tropical and subtropical amphi-Pacific disjunction. The second cooling interval in the mid-Eocene (42-38Ma) resulted in the fragmentation of the boreotropics within Eurasia, leading to an African-Asian disjunction. Multiple dispersal events from North into South America occurred from the early Eocene to late Miocene and a single migration event from Asia into Australia appears to have occurred in the early Miocene.},

Previous molecular studies on these taxa using cpDNA and nrITS were unable to produce well-resolved phylogenetic trees. In this study, we explored the potential of the rpb2 gene as a source of molecular information to better resolve the phylogenetic analysis. Although rpb2 was believed to be a single-copy gene, our cloning results showed that most species examined possessed several copies of these sequences. However, the genetic distance among copies from any one species was low, and these copies always formed monophyletic groups in our molecular trees. Our phylogenetic analyses of rpb2 data resulted in better resolved tree topologies compared to those based on cpDNA or nrITS data. Our results show that monophyly of the genus Litsea is supported only for section Litsea. As a genus, Litsea was shown to be polyphyletic. The genera Actinodaphne and Neolitsea were resolved as monophyletic groups in all analyses. They were also shown to be sisters and closer to the genus Lindera than to the genus Litsea. Our results also revealed that the genus Lindera is not a monophyletic group.},

	abstract = {Most plant phylogeographic studies in subtropical China have stressed the importance of multiple refugia and limited admixture among refugia. Little attention has been paid to range expansion and recolonization routes in this region. In this study, we implemented a phylogeographic survey on Sargentodoxa cuneata, a widespread woody deciduous climber in subtropical China to determine if it conforms to the expansion-contraction (EC) model during the Pleistocene. Sequence variation of two chloroplast intergenic spacers (IGSs) in 369 individuals from 54 populations of S. cuneata was examined. Twenty-six chloroplast haplotypes were recovered. One of these (H5) occurred across the range of S. cuneata and was absent from only 13 populations. Sixteen of the 26 haplotypes were connected to H5 by one mutation and displayed a star-like pattern in the haplotype network. All chloroplast haplotypes clustered into two lineages (A and B) in a Bayesian tree, and most haplotypes (18 out of 26) originated during the mid-Pleistocene (0.63-1.07Ma). Demographic analyses detected a recent range expansion that occurred at 95.98ka (CI: 61.7-112.53ka) for Lineage A. The genetic signature of an ancient range expansion after the Middle Pleistocene Transition (MPT) was also evident. Three recolonization routes were identified in subtropical China. The results suggest that temperate plants in subtropical China may conform to the EC model to some extent. However, the genetic signature from multiple historical processes may complicate the phylogeographic patterns of organisms in the region due to the mild Pleistocene climate. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the evolutionary history of temperate plants in subtropical China.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The Lamiidae, a clade composed of approximately 15\% of all flowering plants, consists of five orders: Boraginales, Gentianales, Garryales, Lamiales, and Solanales; and four families unplaced in an order: Icacinaceae, Metteniusiaceae, Oncothecaceae, and Vahliaceae. Our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of Lamiidae has improved significantly in recent years, however, relationships among the orders and unplaced families of the clade remain partly unresolved. Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the Lamiidae based on an expanded sampling, including all families together, for the first time, in a single phylogenetic analyses. METHODS Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian approaches. Analyses included nine plastid regions (atpB, matK, ndhF, psbBTNH, rbcL, rps4, rps16, trnL-F, and trnV-atpE) and the mitochondrial rps3 region, and 129 samples representing all orders and unplaced families of Lamiidae. KEY RESULTS Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian trees provide good support for Boraginales sister to Lamiales, with successive outgroups (Solanales + Vahlia) and Gentianales, together comprising the core Lamiidae. Early branching patterns are less well supported, with Garryales only poorly supported as sister to the above 'core' and a weakly supported clade composed of Icacinaceae, Metteniusaceae, and Oncothecaceae sister to all other Lamiidae. CONCLUSIONS Our phylogeny of Lamiidae reveals increased resolution and support for internal relationships that have remained elusive. Within Lamiales, greater resolution also is obtained, but some family interrelationships remain a challenge.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing phylogeny is a crucial target of contemporary biology, now commonly approached through computerized analysis of genetic sequence data. In angiosperms, despite recent progress at the ordinal level, many relationships between families remain unclear. Here we take a case study from Lamiales, an angiosperm order in which interfamilial relationships have so far proved particularly problematic. We examine the effect of changing one factor-the quantity of sequence data analyzed-on phylogeny reconstruction in this group. We use simulation to estimate a priori the sequence data that would be needed to resolve an accurate, supported phylogeny of Lamiales. We investigate the effect of increasing the length of sequence data analyzed, the rate of substitution in the sequences used, and of combining gene partitions. This method could be a valuable technique for planning systematic investigations in other problematic groups. Our results suggest that increasing sequence length is a better way to improve support, resolution, and accuracy than employing sequences with a faster substitution rate. Indeed, the latter may in some cases have detrimental effects on phylogeny reconstruction. Further molecular sequencing-of at least 10,000 bp-should result in a fully resolved and supported phylogeny of Lamiales, but at present the problematic aspects of this tree model remain.},

Here we use the genus Isodon (Lamiaceae), a primarily East Asian lineage with disjunct species in central and southern Africa, as a case study to shed light upon these processes. The molecular phylogeny and biogeographic history of Isodon were reconstructed using sequences of three plastid markers, the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS), and a low-copy nuclear gene (LEAFY intron II). The evolution of chromosome numbers in this genus was also investigated using probabilistic models. Our results support a monophyletic Isodon that includes the two disjunct African species, both of which likely formed through allopolyploidy. An overland migration from Asia to Africa through Arabia during the early Miocene is proposed as the most likely explanation for the present disjunct distribution of Isodon. The opening of the Red Sea in the middle Miocene may appear to have had a major role in disrupting floristic exchange between Asia and Africa. In addition, a rapid radiation of Isodon was suggested to occur in the late Miocene. It corresponds with one of the major uplifts of the QTP and subsequent aridification events. Our results support the hypothesis that geological and climatic events play important roles in driving biological diversification of organisms distributed in the QTP area.},

	abstract = {Pogostemon (Lamiaceae; Lamioideae) sensu lato is a large genus consisting of about 80 species with a disjunct African/Asian distribution. The infrageneric taxonomy of the genus has historically been troublesome due to morphological variability and putative convergent evolution within the genus. Notably, some species of Pogostemon are obligately aquatic, perhaps the only Lamiaceae taxa which exhibit this trait. Phylogenetic analyses using the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and five plastid regions (matK, rbcL, rps16, trnH-psbA, trnL-F), confirmed the monophyly of Pogostemon and its sister relationship with the genus Anisomeles. Pogostemon was resolved into two major clades, and none of the three morphologically defined subgenera of Pogostemon were supported as monophyletic. Inflorescence type (spikes with more than two lateral branches vs. a single terminal spike, or rarely with two lateral branches) is phylogenetically informative and consistent with the two main clades we recovered. Accordingly, a new infrageneric classification of Pogostemon consisting of two subgenera is proposed. Molecular dating and biogeographic diversification analyses suggest that Pogostemon split from its sister genus in southern and southeast Asia in the early Miocene. The early strengthening of the Asia monsoon system that was triggered by the uplifting of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau may have played an important role in the subsequent diversification of the genus. In addition, our results suggest that transoceanic long-distance dispersal of Pogostemon from Asia to Africa occurred at least twice, once in the late Miocene and again during the late-Miocene/early-Pliocene.},

	abstract = {AIMS Salvia L. is widely known as the largest genus in the mint family. A morphological modification of the androecium (lever-like stamens) was used to support this genus. However, molecular data revealed that Salvia is polyphyletic. Since phylogenetic studies largely underrepresented Old World Salvia species, we filled this gap and combined new data with existing sequences. The aim of our study was the identification of well-supported clades that provide the basis for evolutionary and taxonomic conclusions. METHODS We included ITS data (internal transcribed spacer) from 220 Salvia species, 86 of which were sequenced for the first time. Additionally, the highly variable plastid marker rpl32-trnL was sequenced, providing new data for 100 Salvia species. These sequences were combined with the accessions available from GenBank. Old World Salvia is represented herein with 57\% of its species. The two datasets were analyzed separately using BI and ML approaches. RESULTS Our data confirm that Salvia is polyphyletic with four distinct evolutionary lineages (Clade I-IV), including five additional genera. The clades strongly reflect the geographical distribution, i.e., Clade IV (East Asia), Clade III (Southwest Asia to Northern Africa), and Clade II (America). The origin of Salvia s.s. (Clade I) is most likely Southwest Asia. A high degree of parallel character evolution was identified in most of the Old World sections. Based on our results, we reconstructed the evolution and biogeography of Salvia s.l. and propose to split this large group into six genera, each supported by geographical distribution, morphology, and karyology. CONCLUSION Salvia s.l. is a polyphyletic group that was originally regarded as a genus because its species share a derived stamen structure. However, phylogenetic data clearly indicate that this floral trait and other morphological characters evolved in parallel. Our study illustrates that the combination of different data sets allows a comprehensive reconstruction of taxa and characteristic evolution, both of which are a precondition for future revision.},

In this study, we present data concerning Salvia in Africa. The focus is on the colonization of the continent, character evolution and the switch of pollination systems in the genus. METHODS Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference were used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Analyses were based on two nuclear markers [internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and external transcribed spacer (ETS)] and one plastid marker (rpl32-trnL). Sequence data were generated for 41 of the 62 African taxa (66 \%). Mesquite was used to reconstruct ancestral character states for distribution, life form, calyx shape, stamen type and pollination syndrome. KEY RESULTS Salvia in Africa is non-monophyletic. Each of the five major regions in Africa, except Madagascar, was colonized at least twice, and floristic links between North African, south-west Asian and European species are strongly supported. The large radiation in Sub-Saharan Africa (23 species) can be traced back to dispersal from North Africa via East Africa to the Cape Region. Adaptation to bird pollination in southern Africa and Madagascar reflects parallel evolution. CONCLUSIONS The phenotypic diversity in African Salvia is associated with repeated introductions to the continent. Many important evolutionary processes, such as colonization, adaptation, parallelism and character transformation, are reflected in this comparatively small group. The data presented in this study can help to understand the evolution of Salvia sensu lato and other large genera.},

	abstract = {The Hawaiian mints (Lamiaceae), one of the largest endemic plant lineages in the archipelago, provide an excellent system to study rapid diversification of a lineage with a remote, likely paleohybrid origin. Since their divergence from New World mints 4-5 million years ago the members of this lineage have diversified greatly and represent a remarkable array of vegetative and reproductive phenotypes. Today many members of this group are endangered or already extinct, and molecular phylogenetic work relies largely on herbarium samples collected during the last century. So far a gene-by-gene approach has been utilized, but the recent radiation of the Hawaiian mints has resulted in minimal sequence divergence and hence poor phylogenetic resolution. In our quest to trace the reticulate evolutionary history of the lineage, a resolved maternal phylogeny is necessary. We applied a high-throughput approach to sequence 12 complete or nearly complete plastid genomes from multiple Hawaiian mint species and relatives, including extinct and rare taxa. We also targeted 108 hypervariable regions from throughout the chloroplast genomes in nearly all of the remaining Hawaiian species, and relatives, using a next-generation amplicon sequencing approach. This procedure generated ∼20Kb of sequence data for each taxon and considerably increased the total number of variable sites over previous analyses. Our results demonstrate the potential of high-throughput sequencing of historic material for evolutionary studies in rapidly evolving lineages. Our study, however, also highlights the challenges of resolving relationships within recent radiations even at the genomic level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The genus Salvia has traditionally included any member of the tribe Mentheae (Lamiaceae) with only two stamens and with each stamen expressing an elongate connective. The recent demonstration of the non-monophyly of the genus presents interesting implications for staminal evolution in the tribe Mentheae. In the context of a molecular phylogeny, the staminal morphology of the various lineages of Salvia and related genera is characterized and an evolutionary interpretation of staminal variation within the tribe Mentheae is presented. METHODS Two molecular analyses are presented in order to investigate phylogenetic relationships in the tribe Mentheae and the genus Salvia. The first presents a tribal survey of the Mentheae and the second concentrates on Salvia and related genera. Schematic sketches are presented for the staminal morphology of each major lineage of Salvia and related genera. KEY RESULTS These analyses suggest an independent origin of the staminal elongate connective on at least three different occasions within the tribe Mentheae, each time with a distinct morphology. Each independent origin of the lever mechanism shows a similar progression of staminal change from slight elongation of the connective tissue separating two fertile thecae to abortion of the posterior thecae and fusion of adjacent posterior thecae. A monophyletic lineage within the Mentheae is characterized consisting of the genera Lepechinia, Melissa, Salvia, Dorystaechas, Meriandra, Zhumeria, Perovskia and Rosmarinus. CONCLUSIONS Based on these results the following are characterized: (1) the independent origin of the staminal lever mechanism on at least three different occasions in Salvia, (2) that Salvia is clearly polyphyletic, with five other genera intercalated within it, and (3) staminal evolution has proceeded in different ways in each of the three lineages of Salvia but has resulted in remarkably similar staminal morphologies.},

The complexity of Stachydeae includes paraphyletic genera, considerable morphological plasticity, a range of ploidy levels, and presumably frequent natural hybridization. We performed parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of nuclear (ribosomal ITS) and plastid (trnL intron, trnL-trnF spacer, rps16 intron) DNA sequence data from a taxonomically and geographically broad sampling of the tribe to identify major evolutionary lineages and to test taxonomic hypotheses within this largest of all lamioid tribes. We included 143 accessions corresponding to 121 species, representing both Old and New World species, and all 12 recognized genera of tribe Stachydeae. Both nuclear and plastid data corroborate monophyly of the tribe, with Melittis as sister to all remaining Stachydeae. For the latter well-supported clade, we suggest the phylogenetic name Eurystachys. Within Eurystachys, although monophyly is supported by both nuclear and plastid data for several named and unnamed groups, the majority of recognized taxa appear to be para- or polyphyletic. The taxon compositions of most subclades are congruent between the plastid and nuclear tree topologies, whereas their relative phylogenetic placements are often not. This level of plastid-nuclear incongruence suggests considerable impact of hybridization in the evolution of Stachydeae.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Lamioideae, one of the most species-rich subfamilies within Lamiaceae, exhibits a remarkable diversity in morphology and habit and is found in many temperate to subtropical regions across the globe. Previous studies based on chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence data produced a tribal classification of Lamioideae, but so far this has not been confirmed with nuclear DNA loci. METHODS We investigated sequence variation in a low-copy nuclear pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) region and compared the phylogenetic results with previously published sequence data from a concatenated data set comprising four cpDNA loci. We incorporated representatives of all 10 lamioid tribes and some unclassified taxa, analyzed the data using phylogenetic inference, and estimated divergence times and ancestral areas for major nodes. KEY RESULTS Our results showed overall topological similarities between the cpDNA and PPR phylogenies with strong support for most tribes. However, we also observed incongruence in the circumscription of some tribes, including Gomphostemmateae and Pogostemoneae and in the relationships among tribes. Our results suggest an Oligocene-Miocene origin of the Lamioideae crown group. Asia and the Mediterranean region appear to have been centers of diversity and place of origin for many lamioid tribes. CONCLUSIONS This study represents the first phylogeny of subfamily Lamioideae inferred from low-copy nuclear DNA data. We show that most lamioid tribes are corroborated, although the exact circumscription of two tribes is questioned. We have shed further light on the evolutionary relationships within Lamioideae, and this study demonstrates the utility of the PPR region for such subfamilial-level phylogenetic studies.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of polyploidy and hybridization usually results in novel genetic combinations, leading to complex, reticulate evolution and incongruence among gene trees, which in turn may show different phylogenetic histories than the inherent species tree. The largest tribe within the subfamily Lamioideae (Lamiaceae), Stachydeae, which includes the globally distributed Stachys, and one of the largest Hawaiian angiosperm radiations, the endemic mints, is a widespread and taxonomically challenging lineage displaying a wide spectrum of morphological and chromosomal diversity. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies have showed that while the Hawaiian mints group with Mexican-South American Stachys based on chloroplast DNA sequence data, nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) sequences suggest that they are most closely related to temperate North American Stachys. Here, we have utilized five independently inherited, low-copy nuclear loci, and a variety of phylogenetic methods, including multi-locus coalescence-based tree reconstructions, to provide insight into the complex origins and evolutionary relationships between the New World Stachys and the Hawaiian mints. Our results demonstrate incongruence between individual gene trees, grouping the Hawaiian mints with both temperate North American and Meso-South American Stachys clades. However, our multi-locus coalescence tree is concurrent with previous nrDNA results placing them within the temperate North American Stachys clade. Our results point toward a possible allopolyploid hybrid origin of the Hawaiian mints arising from temperate North American and Meso-South American ancestors, as well as a reticulate origin for South American Stachys. As such, our study is another significant step toward further understanding the putative parentage and the potential influence of hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting in giving rise to this insular plant lineage, which following colonization underwent rapid morphological and ecological diversification.},

	abstract = {Due to its unique geological history and isolated location, the Hawaiian Archipelago provides an ideal setting for studies on biogeography, phylogeny and population biology. Species richness in these islands has been attributed to unique colonization events. The Hawaiian mints comprising of three endemic genera represent one of the largest radiations in the island. Previous studies have shown the Hawaiian mints to be nested within the dry-fruited Stachys, probably resulting from one or more hybridization events. Stachydeae, the largest tribe in the subfamily Lamioideae (Lamiaceae), is a taxonomically complex and widespread lineage exhibiting remarkable chromosomal diversity. In this paper we attempted at untangling the relationships between the New World and Hawaiian mint taxa, as well as investigate the origin and diversification of the mints in the New World. There seem to have been at least two independent migration events of Stachys to the New World during the Middle to Late Miocene and towards the beginning of the Pliocene, respectively. Results indicate incongruence between the rDNA and cpDNA phylogenies suggesting a reticulate, New World origin for the Hawaiian mints, although dispersal to Hawaii appears to have happened only once during the Pliocene. South American Stachys diversified from their Mesoamerican relatives around Late Pliocene and may also have arisen from similar reticulate events indicated by their intercalating position among the Mesoamerican Stachys species. Further insights into the phylogenetic relationships between the New World mints may be gathered through the study of low copy nuclear loci.},

	abstract = {A phylogeny of basils and allies (Lamiaceae, tribe Ocimeae) based on sequences of the trnL intron, trnL-trnF intergene spacer and rps 16 intron of the plastid genome is presented. Several methods were used to reconstruct phylogenies and to assess statistical support for clades: maximum parsimony with equally and successively weighted characters, bootstrap resampling, and Bayesian inference. The phylogeny is used to investigate the distribution of morphological, pericarp anatomy, chemical, and pollen characters as well as the geographical distribution of the clades. Tribe Ocimeae is monophyletic and easily diagnosable with morphological synapomorphies. There are monophyletic clades within Ocimeae that broadly correspond to currently recognised subtribes: Lavandulinae, Hyptidinae, Ociminae, and Plectranthinae. Only Lavandulinae has clear non-molecular synapomorphies. Several currently recognised genera are not monophyletic. Floral morphology consistent with sternotribic pollination is most common in Ocimeae, but there are independent departures from this model. Buzz pollination is likely in some species, the only postulated occurrence of this within Lamiaceae. Quinone diterpenoids and flavones in the leaf exudates differ in their distributions across the phylogeny and this could contribute to differences in the recorded medicinal as well as pesticidal uses of the species in the different clades. Mapping geographic distribution on to an ultrametric phylogenetic tree produced using non-parametric rate smoothing supports an Asiatic origin for Ocimeae. There are several secondary occurrences in Asia arising from the African Ociminae and Plectranthinae clades. Colonisation of Madagascar occurred at least five times, and New World colonisation occurred at least three times.},

	abstract = {Lagochilus occurs in the arid zones across temperate steppe and desert regions of Northwest China. Cooling with strong dessication in the Pleistocene, along with rapid uplift of mountain ranges peripheral to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, appear to have had major impacts on the genetic structure of the flora. To understand the evolutionary history of Lagochilus and the divergence related to these past shifts of habitats among these regions, we sequenced the plastid intergenic spacers, psbA-trnH and trnS-trnG from populations throughout the known distributions of ten species of the genus. We investigated species-level phylogeographical patterns within Lagochilus. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Neighbor-joining and Bayesian inference. The divergence times of major lineages were estimated with BEAST and IMa. Genetic structure and demographic history were inferred by AMOVA, neutrality tests, mismatch distribution, and Bayesian skyline plot analyses. The results showed that most chloroplast haplotypes were species-specific, and that the phylogeny of Lagochilus is geographically structured. The estimated Bayesian chronology and IMa suggested that the main divergence events for species between major eastern and western portions of the Chinese desert occurred at the Plio-/Pleistocene boundary (ca. 2.1-2.8 Ma ago), and likely coinciding with the formation of these deserts in Northwest China. The regional demographic expansions, in the western region at ca. 0.39 Ma, and in the eastern at ca. 0.06 Ma, or across all regions at ca. 0.26 Ma, showed the response to aridification accompanied by cooling of the Pleistocene sharply increased aridity in the Chinese deserts, which reflects a major influence of geologic and climatic events on the evolution of species of Lagochilus. We suggest that diversification is most likely the result of the past fragmentation due to aridification; the expansion of the range of species along with the deserts was an adaptation to dry and cold environments during the Quaternary.},

Here, we investigated the diversification of Micromeria on the Canary Islands and Madeira at the inter- and infraspecific level using inter simple sequence repeat PCR (ISSR), the trnK-Intron and the trnT-trnL-spacer of the cpDNA and a low copy nuclear gene. The genus Micromeria (Lamiaceae, Mentheae) includes 16 species and 13 subspecies in Macaronesia. Most taxa are restricted endemics, or grow in similar ecological conditions on two islands. An exception is M. varia, a widespread species inhabits the lowland scrub on each island of the archipelago and could represent an ancestral taxon from which radiation started on the different islands. Our analyses support a split between the "eastern" islands Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria and the "western" islands Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro. The colonization of Madeira started from the western Islands, probably from Tenerife as indicated by the sequence data. We identified two lineages of Micromeria on Gomera but all other islands appear to be colonized by a single lineage, supporting adaptive radiation as the major evolutionary force for the diversification of Micromeria. We also discuss the possible role of gene flow between lineages of different Micromeria species on one island after multiple colonizations.},

In the present study, a large-scale phylogenetic reconstruction of Lamiaceae using chloroplast sequences was carried out with the most comprehensive sampling of the family to date (288 species in 191 genera, representing approximately 78\% of the genera of Lamiaceae). Twelve strongly supported primary clades were inferred, which form the phylogenetic backbone of Lamiaceae. Six of the primary clades correspond to the current recognized subfamilies Ajugoideae, Lamioideae, Nepetoideae, Prostantheroideae, Scutellarioideae, and Symphorematoideae, and one corresponds to a portion of Viticoideae. The other five clades comprise: 1) Acrymia and Cymaria; 2) Hymenopyramis, Petraeovitex, Peronema, and Garrettia; 3) Premna, Gmelina, and Cornutia; 4) Callicarpa; and 5) Tectona. Based on these results, three new subfamilies-Cymarioideae, Peronematoideae, and Premnoideae-are described, and the compositions of other subfamilies are updated based on new findings from the last decade. Furthermore, our analyses revealed five strongly supported, more inclusive clades that contain subfamilies, and we give them phylogenetically defined, unranked names: Cymalamiina, Scutelamiina, Perolamiina, Viticisymphorina, and Calliprostantherina.},

Phylogenetic analysis of the combined data sets established monophyly of seven sections (Blakea, Corrugatae, Erythrostachys, Hastatae, Incarnatae, Microsphace, and Sigmoideae) and four major lineages (S. axillaris, "Hastatae clade", "Uliginosae clade", and "core Calosphace"). Sections spanning two or more centers of diversity are not supported by our results; rather, supported relationships exhibit significant geographic structure. Mexico is supported as the geographic origin of Calosphace, and no more than seven dispersal events to South America are required to account for current disjunct distributions.},

Conventional markers (ITS, trnL-trnF and trnH-psbA) have not been able to resolve the relationships among species nor within portions of the backbone of the lineage. We sampled 12 representative species of subgenus Calosphace and included one species of Salvia's s.l. closest relative, Lepechinia, as outgroup. Hybrid enrichment and sequencing were successful, yielding 448 alignments of individual loci with an average length of 704bp. The performance of the phylogenomic data in phylogenetic reconstruction was superior to that of conventional markers, increasing both support and resolution. Because the captured loci vary in the amount of net phylogenetic informativeness at different phylogenetic depths, these data are promising in phylogenetic reconstruction of this group and likely other lineages within Lamiales. However, special attention should be placed on the amount of phylogenetic noise that the data could potentially contain. A prior exploration step using phylogenetic informativeness profiles to detect loci with sites with disproportionately high substitution rates (showing "phantom" spikes) and, if required, the ensuing filtering of the problematic data is recommended. In our dataset, filtering resulted in increased support and resolution for the shallow nodes in maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees resulting from concatenated analyses of all the loci. Additionally, it is expected that an increase in sampling (loci and taxa) will aid in resolving weakly supported, short deep internal branches.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The mint family (Lamiaceae) is the sixth largest family of flowering plants, with the tribe Mentheae containing about a third of the species. We present a detailed perspective on the evolution of the tribe Mentheae based on a phylogenetic analysis of cpDNA and nrDNA that is the most comprehensive to date, a biogeographic set of analyses using a fossil-calibrated chronogram, and an examination of staminal evolution. METHODS Data from four cpDNA and two nrDNA markers representing all extant genera within the tribe Mentheae were analyzed using the programs BEAST, Lagrange, S-DIVA, and BayesTraits. BEAST was used to simultaneously estimate phylogeny and divergence times, Lagrange and S-DIVA were used for biogeographical reconstruction, and BayesTraits was used to infer staminal evolution within the tribe. KEY RESULTS Currently accepted subtribal delimitations are shown to be invalid and are updated. The Mentheae and all five of its subtribes have a Mediterranean origin and have dispersed to the New World multiple times. The vast majority of New World species of subtribe Menthinae are the product of a single dispersal event in the mid-late Miocene. At least four transitions from four stamens to two stamens have occurred within Mentheae, once in the subtribe Salviinae, once in the subtribe Lycopinae, and at least twice in the subtribe Menthinae. CONCLUSIONS Worldwide cooling trends probably played a large role in the diversification and present day distribution of the tribe Mentheae. Additional work is needed to ascertain relationships within some Mentheae genera, especially in the subtribe Menthinae.},

	abstract = {As found in other oceanic islands, the Canary Islands include a large number of single island endemic species, some of which form clades that are broadly distributed within the archipelago. The genus Micromeria (Lamiaceae), for instance, includes groups of morphologically similar but ecologically diverse species on each island, representing a great model to investigate niche shifts and adaptation within the Canary Archipelago. Previous attempts to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within the genus did not lead to robust phylogenies, presumably due to introgression and/or incomplete lineage sorting. In this study, we use a newly developed RAD-sequencing method to improve phylogenetic resolution and to better understand relationships among the Canary Island endemic Micromeria. Overall, we obtained 3571 loci that were genotyped for a total of 46 individuals of Micromeria. Our data reconstructed a highly resolved phylogeny, and corroborated the latest species reclassification of the M. varia s.l. species complex, the taxonomically most complicated group within the genus. Furthermore, taxa occupying similar ecological conditions in different islands, were shown to be closely related. This is the case of taxa from the laurel forest from La Gomera and Gran Canaria, suggesting that the laurel forest likely worked as a filter, only allowing the establishment of colonizers already pre-adapted to these conditions. We also found introgression between these species so it is also possible that the genes that facilitated the adaptation to laurel forest were swapped between Gran Canaria and La Gomera. The observations obtained in this study also allowed us to explain the role of introgression in the origin of M. varia s.l. species complex.},

	abstract = {Although the subfamily Nepetoideae (Lamiaceae) is considered to be monophyletic, relationships between tribes, subtribes and genera within the subfamily are poorly understood as complex and possibly homoplasious morphological characters make taxa difficult to delimit. DNA sequence data from three regions (chloroplast: trnK intron; trnL-F; nuclear: ITS) in total including 278 accessions, representing 38 out of 40 genera of subtribe Menthinae and 11 outgroup genera, were used to reconstruct the evolutionary history, test previous hypotheses of classification, explain biogeographic patterns and elucidate character evolution. Using maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian analysis phylogenetic reconstructions based on nuclear and chloroplast sequence data were incongruent, consequently the data were analyzed separately. Both nuclear and chloroplast datasets provide strong support for three major lineages: the "Satureja", "Micromeria" and "Clinopodium" group. The first contains members of Satureja and Gontscharovia. In the second lineage Micromeria s.str. and Origanum were resolved as monophyletic, Pentapleura and Zataria indicated as sister groups. Thymbra includes two species of Satureja turning the latter genus polyphyletic. Thymus is revealed as paraphyletic with respect to Argantoniella and Saccocalyx in both and Origanum in the plastid dataset only. In the third lineage, the Clinopodium-group, branching pattern is highly incongruent among datasets and possibly influenced by recent and ancient hybridization, chloroplast capture and incomplete lineage sorting. However, identical terminal groups are inferred in both analyses. A Madagascan lineage of "Micromeria", sister to the recently described South African Killickia, is suggested to represent a new genus. The Himalayan Clinopodium nepalense group and the tropical African C. abyssinicum alliance are monophyletic but indicated in different positions. Both groups appear in the ITS phylogeny in a clade with Cyclotrichium and Mentha, relationships not suggested previously. The enigmatic Micromeria cymuligera is close to Mentha and possibly is a representative of this genus. Species of Acinos, now regarded as part of Clinopodium, are mixed up with species of Ziziphora, questioning either the inclusion of Acinos in Clinopodium or generic distinctness of Ziziphora. All data sets suggest a monophyly of the New World taxa and argue for long distance dispersal from the Old World, rather than a vicariance explanation. Bystropogon marks the split up between the two lineages. Inclusion of 22 genera intermixed with Clinopodium spp. in the New World clade provides evidence that the current circumscription of the genus is highly unnatural. Low sequence divergence resulting in low phylogenetic resolution especially at the base of the clade indicate a rapid radiation accompanied by considerable ecological diversification and speciation.},

	abstract = {Koeberlinia, comprising a single xerophytic species K. spinosa, had previously been placed in various families, mainly Capparaceae. Current molecular evidence now places it in its own family Koeberliniaceae, thought to be related to the Bataceae/Salvadoraceae among the 17 other families of the Brassicales. We investigated 55 embryological characters of the genus, most of which are not understood yet, and thereby assessed its systematic relationships. Koeberlinia has many embryological features in common with the Capparaceae and seven other core-Brassicalean families (i.e., Brassicaceae, Cleomaceae, Emblingiaceae, Gyrostemonaceae, Pentadiplandraceae, Resedaceae, and Tovariaceae), specifically by possessing a campylotropous ovule with a nonmultiplicative (two-cell-layered) outer integument, reniform seeds with a curved embryo, and a fibrous exotegmen in the mature seed coat. However, Koeberlinia is clearly distinguished from them by a tenuinucellate rather than crassinucellate ovule as previously reported, markedly enlarged apical nucellar epidermal cells, and an "exotestal" seed coat. Embryologically, Koeberlinia resembles neither the Bataceae nor the Salvadoraceae, although only limited embryological data are available for these two families. Embryological evidence thus favors its joining the core Brassicales, but additional molecular analyses and embryological studies on the missing data of the Bataceae and Salvadoraceae are needed for final confirmation of its phylogenetic position.},

Triglochin has an almost cosmopolitan distribution with Australia as centre of species diversity. Trans-Atlantic and trans-African disjunctions exist in the genus. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on molecular data obtained from nuclear (ITS, internal transcribed spacer) and chloroplast sequence data (psbA-trnH spacer, matK gene). Based on the phylogeny of the group divergence times were estimated and ancestral distribution areas reconstructed. Our data confirm the monophyly of Triglochin and resolve relationships between the major lineages of the genus. The sister group relationship between the Mediterranean/African T. bulbosa complex and the American T. scilloides (formerly Lilaea s.) is strongly supported. This clade is sister to the rest of the genus which contains two main clades. In the first, the widespread T. striata is sister to a clade comprising annual Triglochin species from Australia. The second clade comprises T. palustris as sister to the T. maritima complex, of which the latter is further divided into a Eurasian and an American subclade. Taxonomic diversity in some clades appears to be linked to habitat shifts and is not present in old but ecologically invariable lineages such as the non-monophyletic T. maritima. Diversification in Triglochin began in the Miocene or Oligocene, and most disjunctions in Triglochin were dated to the Miocene.},

Luzula is monophyletic, but species relationships within the genus are difficult to determine primarily due to the similar morphology even within geographically remote taxa (especially within the section Luzula). The plastome trnL intron, trnL-F intergenic spacer and the nuclear ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions were analysed using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood reconstruction in 93 species of Luzula. The incongruent phylogenetic signals obtained from the chloroplast and the nuclear genomes point to incomplete lineage sorting as well as recent hybridisation in this group. Although tree-building analyses revealed several well-supported lineages, the outcomes for many groups were ambiguous. In the total evidence tree, Luzula species were grouped within six main clades (1. subgenus Marlenia, 2. subgenus Pterodes except for L. pilosa, 3. sections Anthelaea and Nodulosae, 4. sections Diprophyllatae and Thyrsanochlamydeae, 5. section Alpinae except for a few species and 6. section Luzula). The subgenus Marlenia occupies the early derived lineage within the genus Luzula. The traditionally accepted subgenera Pterodes and Luzula (and its sections) appear to be non-monophyletic. A statistical parsimony network approach showed that ancient haplotypes and ribotypes co-occur with their descendants in Luzula. Furthermore, many haplotypes are shared among different species. Within the Luzula section Luzula, both recent hybridisation and incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms may represent potential sources of the incongruence between chloroplast and nuclear data.},

The speciation and phylogenetic relationships among Chinese Juglans remain unclear. Here, we used results from phylogenomic and population genetic analyses, transcriptomics, Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS), and whole chloroplast genomes (Cp genome) data to infer processes of lineage formation among the five native Chinese species of the walnut genus (Juglans, Juglandaceae), a widespread, economically important group. We found that the processes of isolation generated diversity during glaciations, but that the recent range expansion of J. regia, probably from multiple refugia, led to hybrid formation both within and between sections of the genus. In southern China, human dispersal of J. regia brought it into contact with J. sigillata, which we determined to be an ecotype of J. regia that is now maintained as a landrace. In northern China, walnut hybridized with a distinct lineage of J. mandshurica to form J. hopeiensis, a controversial taxon (considered threatened) that our data indicate is a horticultural variety. Comparisons among whole chloroplast genomes and nuclear transcriptome analyses provided conflicting evidence for the timing of the divergence of Chinese Juglans taxa. J. cathayensis and J. mandshurica are poorly differentiated based our genomic data. Reconstruction of Juglans evolutionary history indicate that episodes of climatic variation over the past 4.5 to 33.80 million years, associated with glacial advances and retreats and population isolation, have shaped Chinese walnut demography and evolution, even in the presence of gene flow and introgression.},

	doi = {10.1080/10635150701408523},
	abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that integrating fossils into data sets of extant taxa is imperative for proper placement of fossils, resolution of relationships, and a better understanding of character evolution. The importance of this process has been further magnified because of the crucial role of fossils in dating divergence times. Outstanding issues remain, including appropriate methods to place fossils in phylogenetic trees, the importance of molecules versus morphology in these analyses, as well as the impact of potentially large amounts of missing data for fossil taxa. In this study we used the angiosperm clade Juglandaceae as a model for investigating methods of integrating fossils into a phylogenetic framework of extant taxa. The clade has a rich fossil record relative to low extant diversity, as well as a robust molecular phylogeny and morphological database for extant taxa. After combining fossil organ genera into composite and terminal taxa, our objectives were to (1) compare multiple methods for the integration of the fossils and extant taxa (including total evidence, molecular scaffolds, and molecular matrix representation with parsimony [MRP]); (2) explore the impact of missing data (incomplete taxa and characters) and the evidence for placing fossils on the topology; (3) simulate the phylogenetic effect of missing data by creating "artificial fossils"; and (4) place fossils and compare the impact of single and multiple fossil constraints in estimating the age of clades. Despite large and variable amounts of missing data, each of the methods provided reasonable placement of both fossils and simulated "artificial fossils" in the phylogeny previously inferred only from extant taxa. Our results clearly show that the amount of missing data in any given taxon is not by itself an operational guideline for excluding fossils from analysis. Three fossil taxa (Cruciptera simsonii, Paleoplatycarya wingii, and Platycarya americana) were placed within crown clades containing living taxa for which relationships previously had been suggested based on morphology, whereas Polyptera manningii, a mosaic taxon with equivocal affinities, was placed firmly as sister to two modern crown clades. The position of Paleooreomunnea stoneana was ambiguous with total evidence but conclusive with DNA scaffolds and MRP. There was less disturbance of relationships among extant taxa using a total evidence approach, and the DNA scaffold approach did not provide improved resolution or internal support for clades compared to total evidence, whereas weighted MRP retained comparable levels of support but lost crown clade resolution. Multiple internal minimum age constraints generally provided reasonable age estimates, but the use of single constraints provided by extinct genera tended to underestimate clade ages.},

In this study, a total of 23 individuals, representing 2 Chinese Ixiolirion species, were sampled to test the effectiveness of 3 DNA barcodes [internal transcribed spacer (ITS), chloroplast tRNA intron, and megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase] for species identification. Of the 3 DNA barcodes, ITS displayed the maximum level of polymerase chain reaction and sequencing success as well as the highest sequence variation. Intra-specific sequence distances of ITS, chloroplast tRNA intron, and megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase were 0, 0, and 0-0.1\%, respectively, with 8.3, 0.6, and 0.5\% as mean inter-specific distances, respectively. All individuals of each species formed a monophyletic group (clade) in the neighbor-joining trees constructed using the 3 single-DNA barcodes. Our results demonstrated that ITS, chloroplast tRNA intron, and megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase DNA markers could be used to identify Ixiolirion species.

Increasing our knowledge about the specific origin of each polyploid or phylogenetic relationship among species has been hampered because of conserved morphological variation and scarce habitats. We present several hypotheses concerning the speciation pathways of Isoëtes species distributed in East Asia. Our hypotheses are inferred from phylogenetic relationships that were elucidated using sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA, a second intron of LEAFY, and chloroplast DNA trnS-psbC spacer regions. These inferred phylogenetic relationships indicated that (1) the Chinese tetraploid, I. sinensis, is closely related to I. yunguiensis; (2) the Korean endemic species, I. hallasanensis, is an autotetraploid derived from I. taiwanensis or closely related taxa; (3) the hexaploid I. coreana forms a clade and has its closest evolutionary relationships with I. taiwanensis or I. hallasanensis; and (4) the Japanese hexaploid I. japonica is closely related to I. taiwanensis-I. coreana and I. sinensis-I. yunguiensis. These results suggest that interspecific hybridization and polyploidization have played central roles in speciation of East Asian Isoëtes. Furthermore, I. taiwanensis, an endemic species in Taiwan, has been involved in at least three cases of autopolyploid or allopolyploid speciation in East Asia.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The Asparagales, with ca. 40\% of all monocotyledons, include a host of commercially important ornamentals in families such as Orchidaceae, Alliaceae, and Iridaceae, and several important crop species in genera such as Allium, Aloe, Asparagus, Crocus, and Vanilla. Though the order is well defined, the number of recognized families, their circumscription, and relationships are somewhat controversial. METHODS Phylogenetic analyses of Asparagales were based on parsimony and maximum likelihood using nucleotide sequence variation in three plastid genes (matK, ndhF, and rbcL) and two mitochondrial genes (atp1 and cob). Branch support was assessed using both jackknife analysis implementing strict-consensus (SC) and bootstrap analysis implementing frequency-within-replicates (FWR). The contribution of edited sites in the mitochondrial genes to topology and branch support was investigated. KEY RESULTS The topologies recovered largely agree with previous results, though some clades remain poorly resolved (e.g., Ruscaceae). When the edited sites were included in the analysis, the plastid and mitochondrial genes were highly incongruent. However, when the edited sites were removed, the two partitions became congruent. CONCLUSIONS Some deeper nodes in the Asparagales tree remain poorly resolved or unresolved as do the relationships of certain monogeneric families (e.g., Aphyllanthaceae, Ixioliriaceae, Doryanthaceae), whereas support for many families increases. However, the increased support is dominated by plastid data, and the potential influence of mitochondrial and biparentially inherited single or low-copy nuclear genes should be investigated.},

	abstract = {DNA barcoding aims to develop an efficient tool for species identification based on short and standardized DNA sequences. In this study, the DNA barcode paradigm was tested among the genera of the tribe Sisyrinchieae (Iridoideae). Sisyrinchium, with more than 77\% of the species richness in the tribe, is a taxonomically complex genus. A total of 185 samples belonging to 98 species of Sisyrinchium, Olsynium, Orthrosanthus and Solenomelus were tested using matK, trnH-psbA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Candidate DNA barcodes were analysed either as single markers or in combination. Detection of a barcoding gap, similarity-based methods and tree-based analyses were used to assess the discrimination efficiency of DNA barcodes. The levels of species identification obtained from plastid barcodes were low and ranged from 17.35\% to 20.41\% for matK and 5.11\% to 7.14\% for trnH-psbA. The ITS provided better results with 30.61-38.78\% of species identified. The analyses of the combined data sets did not result in a significant improvement in the discrimination rate. Among the tree-based methods, the best taxonomic resolution was obtained with Bayesian inference, particularly when the three data sets were combined. The study illustrates the difficulties for DNA barcoding to identify species in evolutionary complex lineages. Plastid markers are not recommended for barcoding Sisyrinchium due to the low discrimination power observed. ITS gave better results and may be used as a starting point for species identification.},

	abstract = {There has been much debate over the origin of species diversity in biodiversity hotspots, particularly the rate of speciation over extinction and the geographic mode of speciation. Here, we looked at speciation with varying degrees of sympatry in a biodiversity hotspot, focusing on a distinct morphological clade in the Cape Floristic Region in southern Africa, the Gladiolus carinatus species complex (Iridaceae). We investigate the mechanisms involved in population and species differentiation through a combination of ecological and genomic approaches. We estimated spatial and phenological overlap, differences in floral morphology, genetic isolation and genomic selection. A genetic coalescent analysis estimated that the time of divergence between lineages followed the establishment of available habitat in the Cape littoral plain where these species currently overlap geographically. Marked shifts in flowering time and morphology, which act as barriers to gene flow, have developed to varying degrees over the last 0.3-1.4 million years. An amplified fragment length polymorphism genome scan revealed signatures of divergent and balancing selection, although half of the loci consistently behaved neutrally. Divergent species outliers (1\%) and floral morph outliers (3\%) represent a small proportion of the genome, but these loci produced clear genetic clusters of species and significant associations with floral traits. These results indicate that the G. carinatus complex represents a continuum of recent speciation. We provide further evidence for ecological adaptation in the face of gene flow.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0106459},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND Iris L. s.l. is one of the most diverse and well-known genera in the Asparagales, with approximately 250-300 circumscribed species and significant economic impact. The taxonomy of the genus has suffered dramatic changes in the last century, particularly in the last decades after the application of molecular techniques. As a result several contrasting systematic arrangements are currently available to taxonomists. Many genera that were split from Iris s.str. in the past, on the basis of morphology (e.g., Hermodactylus, Iridodictyum, Juno, Pardanthopsis, and Xiphion, among others), are now a priori re-included in a very widely circumscribed Iris s.l. (incl. Belamcanda). This resulted in a more heterogeneous genus that is more difficult to define on morphological grounds. Testing congruence between taxonomic treatments and the results of recent molecular studies of Iris has never been performed, mostly due to the lack of proper taxonomic context. RESULTS We generated several conventional phylogenies for Iris \& outgroups using extensive sampling of taxa (187) and characters (10 plastid loci). We demonstrate that the natural history of Iris, written either as conventional molecular phylogenies or, if viewing in the context of the comparative approach, as a nested most parsimonious hierarchy of patterns, appear to be fully congruent with the narrow taxonomical treatment of the genus, restricted to the rhizomatous "bearded" taxa. The resulting topologies place Belamcanda, Pardanthopsis, and Gattenhofia as sisters to Iris s.str. and genus Siphonostylis as sister to Iris s.l. CONCLUSION The present study clearly justifies the splitting of Iris s.l. into at least 23 genera, 18 of which have already been accepted in the past by numerous authorities. These genera are characterized by unique combinations of partly overlapping morphological characters and biogeography. Moreover, nearly the same entities, which we here recognize at a generic rank, were for centuries frequently referred to by horticulturists as "working-name" groups.},

	doi = {10.1093/aob/mcs127},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The Neotropical tribe Trimezieae are taxonomically difficult. They are generally characterized by the absence of the features used to delimit their sister group Tigridieae. Delimiting the four genera that make up Trimezieae is also problematic. Previous family-level phylogenetic analyses have not examined the monophyly of the tribe or relationships within it. Reconstructing the phylogeny of Trimezieae will allow us to evaluate the status of the tribe and genera and to examine the suitability of characters traditionally used in their taxonomy. METHODS Maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses are presented for 37 species representing all four genera of Trimezieae. Analyses were based on nrITS sequences and a combined plastid dataset. Ancestral character state reconstructions were used to investigate the evolution of ten morphological characters previously considered taxonomically useful. KEY RESULTS Analyses of nrITS and plastid datasets strongly support the monophyly of Trimezieae and recover four principal clades with varying levels of support; these clades do not correspond to the currently recognized genera. Relationships within the four clades are not consistently resolved, although the conflicting resolutions are not strongly supported in individual analyses. Ancestral character state reconstructions suggest considerable homoplasy, especially in the floral characters used to delimit Pseudotrimezia. CONCLUSIONS The results strongly support recognition of Trimezieae as a tribe but suggest that both generic- and species-level taxonomy need revision. Further molecular analyses, with increased sampling of taxa and markers, are needed to support any revision. Such analyses will help determine the causes of discordance between the plastid and nuclear data and provide a framework for identifying potential morphological synapomorphies for infra-tribal groups. The results also suggest Trimezieae provide a promising model for evolutionary research.},

	abstract = {Crocus consists of about 100 species distributed from western Europe and northern Africa to western China, with the center of diversity on the Balkan Peninsula and in Asia Minor. Our study focuses on clarifying phylogenetic relationships and chromosome number evolution within the genus using sequences of the chloroplast trnL-F region, the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and a part of the nuclear single-copy gene pCOSAt103. In a combined dataset of ITS and trnL-F sequences, 115 individuals representing 110 taxa from both subgenera and all sections and series of Crocus were analyzed with Bayesian phylogenetic inference. For pCOSAt103 79 individuals representing 74 Crocus taxa were included, and for the majority of them PCR amplicons were cloned and up to eight clones per individual were sequenced to detect allopolyploidization events. Romulea species were included as outgroup in both analyses. Characteristics of seed surface structures were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS/trnL-F data resulted in a monophyletic genus Crocus, probably monophyletic sections Crocus and Nudiscapus, and inferred monophyly for eight of the 15 series of the genus. The C. biflorus aggregate, thought to be consisting of closely related subspecies, was found to be polyphyletic, the taxa occurring within three major clades in the phylogenetic tree. Cloning of pCOSAt103 resulted in the detection of homoeologous copies in about one third of the taxa of section Nudiscapus, indicating an allotetraploid origin of this section. Reconstruction of chromosome number evolution along the phylogenetic tree using a probabilistic and a parsimony approach arrived at partly contradictory results. Both analyses agreed however on the occurrence of multiple polyploidization and dysploidy events. B chromosomes evolved at least five times independently within the genus, preferentially in clades characterized by karyotype changes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Sisyrinchium (Iridaceae: Iridoideae: Sisyrinchieae) is one of the largest, most widespread and most taxonomically complex genera in Iridaceae, with all species except one native to the American continent. Phylogenetic relationships within the genus were investigated and the evolution of oil-producing structures related to specialized oil-bee pollination examined. METHODS Phylogenetic analyses based on eight molecular markers obtained from 101 Sisyrinchium accessions representing 85 species were conducted in the first extensive phylogenetic analysis of the genus. Total evidence analyses confirmed the monophyly of the genus and retrieved nine major clades weakly connected to the subdivisions previously recognized. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis was used to reconstruct biogeographical patterns, and to trace the evolutionary origin of glandular trichomes present in the flowers of several species. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Glandular trichomes evolved three times independently in the genus. In two cases, these glandular trichomes are oil-secreting, suggesting that the corresponding flowers might be pollinated by oil-bees. Biogeographical patterns indicate expansions from Central America and the northern Andes to the subandean ranges between Chile and Argentina and to the extended area of the Paraná river basin. The distribution of oil-flower species across the phylogenetic trees suggests that oil-producing trichomes may have played a key role in the diversification of the genus, a hypothesis that requires future testing.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Major relationships within Lamiidae, an asterid clade with ∼40000 species, have largely eluded resolution despite two decades of intensive study. The phylogenetic positions of Icacinaceae and other early-diverging lamiid clades (Garryales, Metteniusaceae, and Oncothecaceae) have been particularly problematic, hindering classification and impeding our understanding of early lamiid (and euasterid) character evolution. METHODS To resolve basal lamiid phylogeny, we sequenced 50 plastid genomes using the Illumina sequencing platform and combined these with available asterid plastome sequence data for more comprehensive phylogenetic analyses. KEY RESULTS Our analyses resolved basal lamiid relationships with strong support, including the circumscription and phylogenetic position of the enigmatic Icacinaceae. This greatly improved basal lamiid phylogeny offers insight into character evolution and facilitates an updated classification for this clade, which we present here, including phylogenetic definitions for 10 new or converted clade names. We also offer recommendations for applying this classification to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) system, including the recognition of a reduced Icacinaceae, an expanded Metteniusaceae, and two orders new to APG: Icacinales (Icacinaceae + Oncothecaceae) and Metteniusales (Metteniusaceae). CONCLUSIONS The lamiids possibly radiated from an ancestry of tropical trees with inconspicuous flowers and large, drupaceous fruits, given that these morphological characters are distributed across a grade of lineages (Icacinaceae, Oncothecaceae, Metteniusaceae) subtending the core lamiid clade (Boraginales, Gentianales, Lamiales, Solanales, Vahlia). Furthermore, the presence of similar morphological features among members of Aquifoliales suggests these characters might be ancestral for the Gentianidae (euasterids) as a whole.},

They occur mostly in the Southern Hemisphere with only a few species in the Northern Hemisphere, of which three genera, Hypoxis, Molineria, and Curculigo, with eight species are distributed in China. Recently, we have found a hypoxid-like plant in China that is quite different in floral structure from any of the three genera and even of the known taxa in Hypoxidaceae. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS In addition to morphological analysis, we performed maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses based on fragments of the chloroplast matK and rbcL genes of 60 taxa in 12 families representing all major clades of the Hypoxidaceae alliance. Results showed that Hypoxidaceae is monophyletic and and that the new plant belongs to it, forming a distinct clade within the family Hypoxidaceae as a sister of Molineria. Phylogeny of the Hypoxidaceae family was constructed based on a combined matrix of the chloroplast rbcL, trnS-G, and trnL-F regions of 59 taxa in Hypoxidaceae and its alliance. Findings of the molecular investigation is consistent with those of the morphological analysis.

Data were analyzed by applying parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The intergenic spacer trnS-G--only rarely used in monocot research--contributed a substantial number of potentially parsimony informative characters. Hypoxidaceae consist of three well-supported major clades, but their interrelationships remain unresolved. Our data indicate that in the Pauridia clade one long-distance dispersal event occurred from southern Africa to Australia. Long-distance dispersal scenarios may also be likely for the current distribution of Hypoxis, which occurs on four continents. In the Curculigo clade, the present distribution of Curculigo s.s. on four continents could support a Gondwanan origin, but the level of divergence is too low for this hypothesis to be likely. The main clades correspond well with some floral characters, habit and palynological data, whereas chromosomal data exhibit plasticity and probably result from polyploidization and subsequent dysploidy and/or aneuploidy. Evolutionary flexibility is also suggested by the number of reported pollination syndromes: melittophily, myophily, sapromyophily, and cantharophily. Based on our phylogenetic results, we suggest cautious nomenclatural reorganization to generate monophyly at the generic level.},

Triadenum and Thornea) and three other genera of Hypericaceae to generate an explicit phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus using parsimony and model-based methods. The results indicate that the small genus Triadenum is nested in a clade within Hypericum containing most of the New World species. Sister to Hypericum is Thornea from Central America. Within Hypericum, three large clades and two smaller grades were found; these are based on their general morphology, especially characters used previously in taxonomy of the genus. Relative to the most recent classification, around 60\% of the sections of Hypericum were monophyletic. We used a Bayesian approach to reconstruct ancestral states of selected morphological characters, which resulted in recognition of characters that support major clades within the genus and a revised interpretation of morphological evolution in Hypericum. The shrubby habit represents the plesiomorphic state from which herbs evolved several times. Arborescent species have radiated convergently in high-elevation habitats in tropical Africa and South America.},

	abstract = {The genus Hypericum L. ("St. John's wort", Hypericaceae) comprises nearly 500 species of shrubs, trees and herbs distributed mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but also in high-altitude tropical and subtropical areas. Until now, molecular phylogenetic hypotheses on infra-generic relationships have been based solely on the nuclear marker ITS. Here, we used a full Bayesian approach to simultaneously reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and patterns of morphological and range evolution in Hypericum, using nuclear (ITS) and plastid DNA sequences (psbA-trnH, trnS-trnG, trnL-trnF) of 186 species representing 33 of the 36 described morphological sections. Consistent with other studies, we found that corrections of the branch length prior helped recover more realistic branch lengths in by-gene partitioned Bayesian analyses, but the effect was also seen within single genes if the overall mutation rate differed considerably among sites or regions. Our study confirms that Hypericum is not monophyletic with the genus Triadenum embedded within, and rejects the traditional infrageneric classification, with many sections being para- or polyphyletic. The small Western Palearctic sections Elodes and Adenotrias are the sister-group of a geographic dichotomy between a mainly New World clade and a large Old World clade. Bayesian reconstruction of morphological character states and range evolution show a complex pattern of morphological plasticity and inter-continental movement within the genus. The ancestors of Hypericum were probably tropical shrubs that migrated from Africa to the Palearctic in the Early Tertiary, concurrent with the expansion of tropical climates in northern latitudes. Global climate cooling from the Mid Tertiary onwards might have promoted adaptation to temperate conditions in some lineages, such as the development of the herbaceous habit or unspecialized corollas.},

Characterizing rate discrepancies and evaluating the relative roles of time and rate along branches through the past are both critical to a full understanding of evolutionary history. In this study, we explore the interactions of time and rate in filmy ferns (Hymenophyllaceae), a lineage with extreme branch length differences between the two major clades. We test for the presence of significant rate discrepancies within and between these clades, and we separate time and rate across the filmy fern phylogeny to simultaneously yield an evolutionary time scale of filmy fern diversification and reconstructions of ancestral rates of molecular evolution. Our results indicate that the branch length disparity observed between the major lineages of filmy ferns is indeed due to a significant difference in molecular evolutionary rate. The estimation of divergence times reveals that the timing of crown group diversification was not concurrent for the two lineages, and the reconstruction of ancestral rates of molecular evolution points to a substantial rate deceleration in one of the clades. Further analysis suggests that this may be due to a genome-wide deceleration in the rate of nucleotide substitution.},

Sequences were generated for 53 taxa including Alangium, Camptotheca, Cornus, Curtisia, Davidia, Diplopanax, Mastixia, Nyssa, and four families: Grubbiaceae, Hydrangeaceae, Hydrostachyaceae, and Loasaceae. Fifteen taxa from asterids were used as outgroups. The 26S rDNA sequences were initially analyzed separately and then combined with matK-rbcL sequences, using both parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. Eight strongly supported major clades were identified within Cornales by all analyses: Cornus, Alangium, nyssoids (Nyssa, Davidia, and Camptotheca), mastixioids (Mastixia and Diplopanax), Hydrangeaceae, Loasaceae, Grubbia-Curtisia, and Hydrostachys. However, relationships among the major lineages are not strongly supported in either 26S rDNA or combined 26S rDNA-matK-rbcL topologies, except for the sister relationships between Cornus and Alangium and between nyssoids and mastixioids in the tree from combined data. Discrepancies in relationships among major lineages, especially the placement of the long-branched Hydrostachys, were found between parsimony and maximum likelihood trees in all analyses. Incongruence between the 26S rDNA and matK-rbcL data sets was suggested, where Hydrangeaceae was found to be largely responsible for the incongruence. The long branch of Hydrostachys revealed in previous analyses was reduced significantly with more sampling. Maximum likelihood analysis of combined 26S rDNA-matK-rbcL sequences suggested that Hydrostachys might be sister to the remainder of Cornales, that Cornus-Alangium are sisters, that nyssoids-mastixioids are sisters, and that Hydrangeaceae-Loasaceae are sisters, consistent with previous analyses of matK-rbcL sequence data.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-12-30},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND Hydrocharitaceae is a fully aquatic monocot family, consists of 18 genera with approximately 120 species. The family includes both fresh and marine aquatics and exhibits great diversity in form and habit including annual and perennial life histories; submersed, partially submersed and floating leaf habits and linear to orbicular leaf shapes. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution and is well represented in the Tertiary fossil record in Europe. At present, the historical biogeography of the family is not well understood and the generic relationships remain controversial. In this study we investigated the phylogeny and biogeography of Hydrocharitaceae by integrating fossils and DNA sequences from eight genes. We also conducted ancestral state reconstruction for three morphological characters. RESULTS Phylogenetic analyses produced a phylogeny with most branches strongly supported by bootstrap values greater than 95 and Bayesian posterior probability values of 1.0. Stratiotes is the first diverging lineage with the remaining genera in two clades, one clade consists of Lagarosiphon, Ottelia, Blyxa, Apalanthe, Elodea and Egeria; and the other consists of Hydrocharis-Limnobium, Thalassia, Enhalus, Halophila, Najas, Hydrilla, Vallisneria, Nechamandra and Maidenia. Biogeographic analyses (DIVA, Mesquite) and divergence time estimates (BEAST) resolved the most recent common ancestor of Hydrocharitaceae as being in Asia during the Late Cretaceous and Palaeocene (54.7-72.6 Ma). Dispersals (including long-distance dispersal and migrations through Tethys seaway and land bridges) probably played major roles in the intercontinental distribution of this family. Ancestral state reconstruction suggested that in Hydrocharitaceae evolution of dioecy is bidirectional, viz., from dioecy to hermaphroditism, and from hermaphroditism to dioecy, and that the aerial-submerged leaf habit and short-linear leaf shape are the ancestral states. CONCLUSIONS Our study has shed light on the previously controversial generic phylogeny of Hydrocharitaceae. The study has resolved the historical biogeography of this family and supported dispersal as the most likely explanation for the intercontinental distribution. We have also provided valuable information for understanding the evolution of breeding system and leaf phenotype in aquatic monocots.},

This variation is largely centered around the H. aspera species complex, with numbers of recognized species varying from one to nearly a dozen. Despite indications of molecular variation in this complex, no sequence-based species delimitation methods have been employed to evaluate the primarily morphology-based species boundaries. In the present study, a multi-locus coalescent-based approach to species delimitation is employed in order to identify separate evolutionary lines within H. sect. Asperae, using four chloroplast and four nuclear molecular markers. Eight lineages were recovered within the focal group, of which five correspond with named morphotypes. The other three lineages illustrate types of conflict between molecular species delimitation and traditional morphology-based taxonomy. One molecular lineage comprises two named morphotypes, which possibly diverged recently enough to not have developed sufficient molecular divergence. A second conflict is found in H. strigosa. This morphotype is recovered as a separate lineage when occurring in geographic isolation, but when occurring in sympatry with two other morphotypes (H. aspera and H. robusta), the coalescent species delimitation lumps these taxa into a single putative species.},

	abstract = {The genus Deutzia (Hydrangeaceae), containing ca. 60 species circumscribed in three sections, is disjunctly distributed in eastern Asia and Central America (Mexico). Although the genus is well delimited, its subdivisions into sections and series have not been the subject of an explicit test of monophyly based on molecular data. A comprehensive examination of the evolutionary relationships within the genus is thus still lacking. We present a fossil-calibrated, molecular phylogeny of Deutzia based on two nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS and 26S) and three chloroplast DNA regions (matK, rbcL, and trnL-F intergenic spacer). Within this framework, we examine character evolution in petal arrangement, filament shape, and the number of stamens, and infer the ancestral area and biogeographic history of the genus. Our molecular phylogeny suggests that Deutzia is monophyletic. Two major clades are recovered: one composed of the species of sect. Neodeutzia from Mexico, and the other containing all remaining Deutzia species of sections Mesodeutzia and Deutzia from SW China and Northeast Asia. The latter two Asian sections were each revealed to be polyphyletic. The induplicate petals, 2-dentate filaments, and polystemonous androecia are inferred to be ancestral character states. Biogeographic reconstructions suggest a Northeast Asian origin for the genus and subsequent spread to Mexico during the Oligocene and to SW China during the Miocene. Based on our results, a new infrageneric classification of Deutzia inferred from molecular phylogeny is required. We propose to merge sections Mesodeutzia and Deutzia to ensure the monophyly at the sectional level. Cooling trends during the Oligocene resulted in isolation, separating eastern Asian and Mexican taxa, while the warm period during the middle Miocene stimulated the diversification from Northeast Asia to SW China. The uplift in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and monsoon regimes are important in promoting high species diversification of Deutzia in SW China.},

	abstract = {Utilization of molecular phylogenetic information over the past decade has resulted in clarification of the position of most angiosperms. In contrast, the position of the holoparasitic family Hydnoraceae has remained controversial. To address the question of phylogenetic position of Hydnoraceae among angiosperms, nuclear SSU and LSU rDNA and mitochondrial atp1 and matR sequences were obtained for Hydnora and Prosopanche. These sequences were used in combined analyses that included the above four genes as well as chloroplast rbcL and atpB (these plastid genes are missing in Hydnoraceae and were hence coded as missing). Three data sets were analyzed using maximum parsimony: (1) three genes with 461 taxa; (2) five genes with 77 taxa; and (3) six genes with 38 taxa. Analyses of separate and combined data partitions support the monophyly of Hydnoraceae and the association of that clade with Aristolochiaceae sensu lato (s.l.) (including Lactoridaceae). The latter clade is sister to Piperaceae and Saururaceae. Despite over 11 kilobases (kb) of sequence data, relationships within Aristolochiaceae s.l. remain unresolved, thus it cannot yet be determined whether Aristolochiaceae, Hydnoraceae, and Lactoridaceae should be classified as distinct families. In contrast to most traditional classifications, molecular phylogenetic analyses do not suggest a close relationship between Hydnoraceae and Rafflesiaceae. A number of morphological features is shared by Hydnoraceae and Aristolochiaceae; however, a more resolved phylogeny is required to determine whether these represent synapomorphies or independent acquisitions.},

	doi = {10.1038/nature05612},
	abstract = {Although the relationship of angiosperms to other seed plants remains controversial, great progress has been made in identifying the earliest extant splits in flowering-plant phylogeny, with the discovery that the New Caledonian shrub Amborella trichopoda, the water lilies (Nymphaeales), and the woody Austrobaileyales constitute a basal grade of lines that diverged before the main radiation in the clade. By focusing attention on these ancient lines, this finding has re-written our understanding of angiosperm structural and reproductive biology, physiology, ecology and taxonomy. The discovery of a new basal lineage would lead to further re-evaluation of the initial angiosperm radiation, but would also be unexpected, as nearly all of the approximately 460 flowering-plant families have been surveyed in molecular studies. Here we show that Hydatellaceae, a small family of dwarf aquatics that were formerly interpreted as monocots, are instead a highly modified and previously unrecognized ancient lineage of angiosperms. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of multiple plastid genes and associated noncoding regions from the two genera of Hydatellaceae identify this overlooked family as the sister group of Nymphaeales. This surprising result is further corroborated by evidence from the nuclear gene phytochrome C (PHYC), and by numerous morphological characters. This indicates that water lilies are part of a larger lineage that evolved more extreme and diverse modifications for life in an aquatic habitat than previously recognized.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Species relationships are unknown in Hydatellaceae, a small family of dwarf aquatics related to water lilies that arose near the base of angiosperm phylogeny. Here we use molecular evidence to infer a species tree for the family and apply this to reconstructing major transitions in morphology and sexual system in this early branch of angiosperms. METHODS We assembled plastid (atpB, matK, ndhF, rbcL) and nuclear (ribosomal ITS) data for 50 samples (including outgroups) and estimated a species tree for Hydatellaceae using a Bayesian multispecies coalescent approach. We reconstructed the evolution of several morphological characters, then tested for associations between sexual system and reproductive morphology using phylogenetic ANOVA. KEY RESULTS Dioecious species of Hydatellaceae have significantly greater stamen number and anther length than do cosexual species, suggesting changes in male function. The perennial habit that defines one subclade likely represents a reversion from annuality. Species relationships do not fall along traditional morphological divisions, but new sections proposed here are supported by fruit and seed synapomorphies. The earliest split in the family is reflected in geography and climate (i.e., tropical vs. subtropical/temperate clades). We found limited evidence of incongruence between plastid and nuclear trees, with one exception involving gene-tree nonmonophyly for two close relatives (Trithuria submersa, T. bibracteata). CONCLUSIONS While the direction of sexual-system evolution is ambiguous, transitions are significantly associated with changes in involucral phyllome length and proxies of pollen production. We propose a new sectional circumscription based on fruit, seed, and DNA evidence.},

Based on atpB and trnL-F DNA sequences the tribe is monophyletic only when the genus Pseudoprospero is excluded from Massonieae. In most trnL-F trees, this genus occupies a basal position within subfamily Hyacinthoideae and is sister to the rest of the subfamily. Molecular data suggest that the remaining genera of Massonieae do not share common ancestry with the Eurasian/North-African tribe Hyacintheae Dumort. ( Scilla, Hyacinthus and allies), and thus a narrow concept of the essentially Eurasian genus Scilla is supported. Members of well-supported clades in Massonieae usually show similarities in seed characteristics as determined by scanning electron microscopy. Phylogenetic position and seed morphology indicate that Massonia angustifolia and M. zeyheri do not belong to the genus Massonia but fall into a clade together with Daubenya, Androsiphon and Amphisiphon. The genus Whiteheadia appears paraphyletic in the 50\% majority rule trnL-F tree and occupies a basal position next to Massonia. However, in the strict consensus tree neither monophyly nor polyphyly can be excluded for this genus. Seed appendages are documented for members of the genera Ledebouria and Lachenalia. Within the genera of Massonieae there is a tendency towards bending of the seed axis. This phenomenon is most obvious within the genus Lachenalia. Delimitation of genera based on seed morphology largely agrees with the results of molecular studies. Correlation between number, size and color of seeds, geographical distribution and phylogenetic position of the genera are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The taxonomic arrangement within subfamily Ornithogaloideae (Hyacinthaceae) has been a matter of controversy in recent decades: several new taxonomic treatments have been proposed, based exclusively on plastid DNA sequences, and these have resulted in classifications which are to a great extent contradictory. Some authors have recognized only a single genus Ornithogalum for the whole subfamily, including 250-300 species of variable morphology, whereas others have recognized many genera. In the latter case, the genera are inevitably much smaller and they are better defined morphologically. However, some are not monophyletic as circumscribed. METHODS Phylogenetic analyses of Ornithogaloideae were based on nucleotide sequences of four plastid regions (trnL intron, trnL-F spacer, rbcL and matK) and a nuclear region (ITS). Eighty species covering all relevant taxonomic groups previously recognized in the subfamily were sampled. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses were performed. The molecular data were compared with a matrix of 34 morphological characters. KEY RESULTS Combinations of plastid and nuclear data yielded phylogenetic trees which are better resolved than those obtained with any plastid region alone or plastid regions in combination. Three main clades are found, corresponding to the previously recognized tribes Albuceae, Dipcadieae and Ornithogaleae. In these, up to 19 clades are described which are definable by morphology and biogeography. These mostly correspond to previously described taxa, though some need recircumscription. Morphological characters are assessed for their diagnostic value for taxonomy in the subfamily. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the phylogenetic analyses, 19 monophyletic genera are accepted within Ornithogaloideae: Albuca, Avonsera, Battandiera, Cathissa, Coilonox, Dipcadi, Eliokarmos, Elsiea, Ethesia, Galtonia, Honorius, Loncomelos, Melomphis, Neopatersonia, Nicipe, Ornithogalum, Pseudogaltonia, Stellarioides and Trimelopter. Each of these has a particular syndrome of morphological characters. As a result, 105 new combinations are made and two new names are proposed to accommodate the taxa studied in the new arrangement. A short morphological diagnosis, synonymy, details of distribution and an identification key are presented.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Subfamily Hyacinthoideae (Hyacinthaceae) comprises more than 400 species. Members are distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, India, eastern Asia, the Mediterranean region and Eurasia. Hyacinthoideae, like many other plant lineages, show disjunct distribution patterns. The aim of this study was to reconstruct the biogeographical history of Hyacinthoideae based on phylogenetic analyses, to find the possible ancestral range of Hyacinthoideae and to identify factors responsible for the current disjunct distribution pattern. METHODS Parsimony and Bayesian approaches were applied to obtain phylogenetic trees, based on sequences of the trnL-F region. Biogeographical inferences were obtained by applying statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA) and Bayesian binary MCMC (BBM) analysis implemented in RASP (Reconstruct Ancestral State in Phylogenies). KEY RESULTS S-DIVA and BBM analyses suggest that the Hyacinthoideae clade seem to have originated in sub-Saharan Africa. Dispersal and vicariance played vital roles in creating the disjunct distribution pattern. Results also suggest an early dispersal to the Mediterranean region, and thus the northward route (from sub-Saharan Africa to Mediterranean) of dispersal is plausible for members of subfamily Hyacinthoideae. CONCLUSIONS Biogeographical analyses reveal that subfamily Hyacinthoideae has originated in sub-Saharan Africa. S-DIVA indicates an early dispersal event to the Mediterranean region followed by a vicariance event, which resulted in Hyacintheae and Massonieae tribes. By contrast, BBM analysis favours dispersal to the Mediterranean region, eastern Asia and Europe. Biogeographical analysis suggests that sub-Saharan Africa and the Mediterranean region have played vital roles as centres of diversification and radiation within subfamily Hyacinthoideae. In this bimodal distribution pattern, sub-Saharan Africa is the primary centre of diversity and the Mediterranean region is the secondary centre of diversity. Sub-Saharan Africa was the source area for radiation toward Madagascar, the Mediterranean region and India. Radiations occurred from the Mediterranean region to eastern Asia, Europe, western Asia and India.},

	doi = {10.1111/jipb.12065},
	abstract = {Disjunct distribution patterns in plant lineages are usually explained according to three hypotheses: vicariance, geodispersal, and long-distance dispersal. The role of these hypotheses is tested in Urgineoideae (Hyacinthaceae), a subfamily disjunctly distributed in Africa, Madagascar, India, and the Mediterranean region. The potential ancestral range, dispersal routes, and factors responsible for the current distribution in Urgineoideae are investigated using divergence time estimations. Urgineoideae originated in Southern Africa approximately 48.9 Mya. Two independent dispersal events in the Western Mediterranean region possibly occurred during Early Oligocene and Miocene (29.9-8.5 Mya) via Eastern and Northwestern Africa. A dispersal from Northwestern Africa to India could have occurred between 16.3 and 7.6 Mya. Vicariance and extinction events occurred approximately 21.6 Mya. Colonization of Madagascar occurred between 30.6 and 16.6 Mya, after a single transoceanic dispersal event from Southern Africa. The current disjunct distributions of Urgineoideae are not satisfactorily explained by Gondwana fragmentation or dispersal via boreotropical forests, due to the younger divergence time estimates. The flattened winged seeds of Urgineoideae could have played an important role in long-distance dispersal by strong winds and big storms, whereas geodispersal could have also occurred from Southern Africa to Asia and the Mediterranean region via the so-called arid and high-altitude corridors.},

It was crucial for the formation of the arid environments in south-eastern and western South America. However, both the timing of the major stages of the Andean uplift and the onset of aridity in western South America remain controversial. In this paper we examine the hypothesis that the Andean South American groups of Heliotropium originated and diversified in response to Andean orogeny during the late Miocene and a the subsequent development of aridity. To this end, we estimate divergence times and likely biogeographical origins of the major clades in the phylogeny of Heliotropium, using both Bayesian and likelihood methods. Divergence times of all Andean clades in Heliotropium are estimated to be of late Miocene or Pliocene ages. At least three independent Andean diversification events can be recognized within Heliotropium. Timing of the diversification in the Andean lineages Heliotropium sects.Heliothamnus, Cochranea, Heliotrophytum, Hypsogenia, Plagiomeris, Platygyne clearly correspond to a rapid, late Miocene uplift of the Andes and a Pliocene development of arid environments in South America.},

Heliconias are cultivated as ornamental garden plants, and are of increasing importance as cut flowers. However, there are taxonomic confusions and uncertainties about the number of species and the relationships among them. Molecular studies are therefore necessary for better understanding of the species boundaries of these plants. We examined the genetic variability and the phylogenetic relationships of 124 accessions of the genus Heliconia based on RAPD markers. Phenetic and cladistic analyses, using 231 polymorphic RAPD markers, demonstrated that the genus Heliconia is monophyletic. Groupings corresponding to currently recognized species and some subgenera were found, and cultivars and hybrids were found to cluster with their parents.

Andersson, H. stricta Huber, H. wagneriana Petersen, and H. psittacorum L. f., as well as that of several interspecific hybrids such as H. psittacorum L. f. x H. spathocircinata Aristeguieta and H. caribaea Lamarck x H. bihai (L.) L. We also created an approximation to their phylogenetic analysis. Molecular analysis using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers revealed a total of 170 bands. Two large, well-defined groups resulted: the first grouped cultivars of the very closely related H. caribaea and H. bihai species with those of H. orthotricha and H. psittacorum, and the second grouped H. stricta and H. wagneriana cultivars. The lowest percentage of polymorphism was found in H. psittacorum (17.65\%) and the highest was in H. stricta (55.88\%). Using AFLP, phylogenetic analysis of the species studied revealed the monophyletic origin of the Heliconiaceae family, and identified the Heliconia subgenus as monophyletic while providing evidence of the polyphyletic origin of several representatives of the Stenochlamys subgenus.},

	abstract = {Heliconia (Heliconiaceae, order Zingiberales) is among the showiest plants of the Neotropical rainforest and represent a spectacular co-evolutionary radiation with hummingbirds. Despite the attractiveness and ecological importance of many Heliconia, the genus has been the subject of limited molecular phylogenetic studies. We sample seven markers from the plastid and nuclear genomes for 202 samples of Heliconia. This represents ca. 75\% of accepted species and includes coverage of all taxonomic subgenera and sections. We date this phylogeny using fossils associated with other families in the Zingiberales; in particular we review and evaluate the Eocene fossil Ensete oregonense. We use this dated phylogenetic framework to evaluate the evolution of two components of flower orientation that are hypothesized to be important for modulating pollinator discrimination and pollen placement: resupination and erect versus pendant inflorescence habit. Our phylogenetic results suggest that the monophyletic Melanesian subgenus Heliconiopsis and a small clade of Ecuadorian species are together the sister group to the rest of Heliconia. Extant diversity of Heliconia originated in the Late Eocene (39Ma) with rapid diversification through the Early Miocene, making it the oldest known clade of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Most described subgenera and sections are not monophyletic, though closely related groups of species, often defined by shared geography, mirror earlier morphological cladistic analyses. Evaluation of changes in resupination and inflorescence habit suggests that these characters are more homoplasious than expected, and this largely explains the non-monophyly of previously circumscribed subgenera, which were based on these characters. We also find strong evidence for the correlated evolution of resupination and inflorescence habit. The correlated model suggests that the most recent common ancestor of all extant Heliconia had resupinate flowers and erect inflorescences. Finally, we note our nearly complete species sampling and dated phylogeny allow for an assessment of taxonomic history in terms of phylogenetic diversity. We find approximately half of the currently recognized species, corresponding to half of the phylogenetic diversity, have been described since 1975, highlighting the continued importance of basic taxonomic research and conservation initiatives to preserve both described and undiscovered species of Heliconia.},

	abstract = {The evolution of the eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunction of the witch-hazel genus Hamamelis L. (Hamamelidaceae) was examined through phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses. Phylogenetic relationships of all Hamamelis species were reconstructed using parsimony and Bayesian analyses of sequence data from six plastid (trnL-F, psaA-ycf3, rps16, matK, atpB-rbcL, and psbA-trnH) and two nuclear (ITS and ETS) DNA regions. The phylogeny was then used to infer the biogeographic origin and subsequent diversification using both event-based (DIVA) and maximum likelihood (LAGRANGE) methods incorporating fossil data. The times of divergence within Hamamelis were estimated with the Bayesian approach using the program BEAST. A very low level of molecular variation was detected in both the plastid and the nuclear DNA regions within Hamamelis. The combined analyses resulted in a phylogeny of the genus with higher resolution and support values. Hamamelis was supported to be monophyletic with H. mollis from eastern China diverged first in the genus. All North American species formed a clade and was sister to the eastern Asian H. japonica. Within the North American clade, H. mexicana was sister to H. vernalis, and the recently described species H. ovalis was found to be closely related to the widespread species H. virginiana. The stem age of Hamamelis was estimated to be at the Eocene (51.2 mya, with 95\% HDP: 49.0-54.6 mya), and the crown age of the genus was dated to be at the late Miocene (9.7 mya, with 95\% HDP: 3.6-18.1 mya, or 10.6 mya, with 95\% HDP: 4.2-19.6 mya). The disjunction between the eastern Asian and the eastern North American species was dated to be 7.1 mya (95\% HDP: 3.1-13.6 mya) or 7.7 mya (95\% HDP: 3.4-13.6 mya). Biogeographic analyses incorporating fossils resulted in more equally possible solutions at the stem lineage of Hamamelis than those including extant species only. Eastern Asia is inferred to be the most-likely area for the origin of Hamamelis. The current disjunction was due to the extinction in western North America and Europe from Eocene to late Miocene, and later migration from eastern Asia into North America. The Bering land bridge was hypothesized to have played an important role in the evolution of this disjunction. The current species diversity of the genus was the result of relatively recent diversification events during the late Miocene rather than long accumulation of lineages from the early Tertiary.},

	abstract = {Haloragaceae are a cosmopolitan plant family with its centre of diversity in Australia. Here, we investigate the historical biogeography of the family and the role of vicariance or dispersal in shaping its current distribution. DNA sequences from ITS, matK and the trnK 5' and trnK 3' introns were obtained for 102 species representing all 8 genera of Haloragaceae for use in Bayesian molecular dating. Molecular dating was conducted using two macrofossils as calibration points for the analyses. Biogeographic history was investigated using a Bayesian dispersal-vicariance analysis and a dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis model. The results suggest that the earliest diversification of the extant Haloragaceae occurred in Australia during the Eocene (37.3-56.3Ma). Early diversification of the family in the Southern Hemisphere is inferred as resulting from vicariance events among Australia, South America and New Zealand. The results also indicate multiple out of Australia dispersal routes, primarily including (1) from Australia to Asia during the Miocene, with subsequent dispersal to Europe and North America; (2) from Australia to New Zealand, then to South America during the Miocene and Pliocene. Most of the inferred dispersal events occurred throughout the Miocene and later, and are biased towards the aquatic Haloragaceae lineages.},

Commencement of tribal and generic divergence in the subfamilies occured in the Eocene in the two regions, but subsequent patterns of radiation differ slightly. The hypothesis of rapid recent speciation in these regions from the late Pliocene as the major explanation for endemic species richness is still repeated by several contemporary authors despite increasing molecular phylogenetic evidence to the contrary. Our estimates of the age of lineages in Haemodoraceae show significant lineage turnover occurring over the last 15 million years, since the mid-Miocene, with divergence of the major clades beginning in the Eocene. The search for independent evidence to date speciation episodes reliably and investigation of molecular analyses across a broad spectrum of these clades must be pursued to advance ideas rigorously concerning origins of species richness. These regions continue to confound attempts to develop theory concerning origins of global species richness, with consequent implications for conservation biology.},

This group has huge ecological and economic value, and has drawn great interest from the scientific community. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of gymnosperm evolution and biogeography, including phylogenetic relationships at different taxonomic levels, patterns of species diversification, roles of vicariance and dispersal in development of intercontinental disjunctions, modes of molecular evolution in different genomes and lineages, and mechanisms underlying the formation of large nuclear genomes. It is particularly interesting that increasing evidence supports a sister relationship between Gnetales and Pinaceae (the Gnepine hypothesis) and the contribution of recent radiations to present species diversity, and that expansion of retrotransposons is responsible for the large and complex nuclear genome of gymnosperms. In addition, multiple coniferous genera such as Picea very likely originated in North America and migrated into the Old World, further indicating that the center of diversity is not necessarily the place of origin. The Bering Land Bridge acted as an important pathway for dispersal of gymnosperms in the Northern Hemisphere. Moreover, the genome sequences of conifers provide an unprecedented opportunity and an important platform for the evolutionary studies of gymnosperms, and will also shed new light on evolution of many important gene families and biological pathways in seed plants.},

	abstract = {The popular view that plant mitochondrial genome evolves slowly in sequence has been recently challenged by the extraordinarily high substitution rates of mtDNA documented mainly from several angiosperm genera, but high substitution rate acceleration accompanied with great length variation has been very rarely reported in plant mitochondrial genes. Here, we studied evolution of the mitochondrial rps3 gene that encodes the ribosomal small subunit protein 3 and found a dramatically high variation in both length and sequence of an exon region of it in Conifer II. A sequence comparison between cDNA and genomic DNA showed that there are no RNA editing sites in the Conifer II rps3 gene. Southern blotting analyses of the total DNA and mtDNA, together with the real-time PCR analysis, showed that rps3 exists as a single mitochondrial locus in gymnosperms. It is very likely that the Conifer II rps3 gene has experienced retroprocessing, i.e., the re-integration of its cDNA into the mitochondrial genome, followed by an evolutionary acceleration due to the intron loss. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis of rps3 supports the sister relationship between conifers and Gnetales. In particular, the monophyly of conifer II is strongly supported by the shared loss of two rps3 introns. Our results also indicate that the mitochondrial gene tree would be affected in topology when the "edited" paralogs are analyzed together with their genomic sequences.},

	abstract = {Though considerable progress has been made in inferring phylogenetic relationships of many plant lineages, deep unresolved nodes remain a common problem that can impact downstream efforts, including taxonomic decision-making and character reconstruction. The Core Goodeniaceae is a group affected by this issue: data from the plastid regions trnL-trnF and matK have been insufficient to generate adequate support at key nodes along the backbone of the phylogeny. We performed genome skimming for 24 taxa representing major clades within Core Goodeniaceae. The plastome coding regions (CDS) and nuclear ribosomal repeats (NRR) were assembled and complemented with additional accessions sequenced for nuclear G3PDH and plastid trnL-trnF and matk. The CDS, NRR, and G3PDH alignments were analyzed independently and topology tests were used to detect the alignments' ability to reject alternative topologies. The CDS, NRR, and G3PDH alignments independently supported a Brunonia (Scaevola s.l. (Coopernookia (Goodenia s.l.))) backbone topology, but within Goodenia s.l., the strongly-supported plastome topology (Goodenia A (Goodenia B (Velleia+Goodenia C))) contrasts with the poorly supported nuclear topology ((Goodenia A+Goodenia B) (Velleia+Goodenia C)). A fully resolved and maximally supported topology for Core Goodeniaceae was recovered from the plastome CDS, and there is excellent support for most of the major clades and relationships among them in all alignments. The composition of these seven major clades renders many of the current taxonomic divisions non-monophyletic, prompting us to suggest that Goodenia may be split into several segregate genera.},

	abstract = {The cpDNA of Welwitschia mirabilis (the only species of Welwitschiales) was recently reported to be the most reduced and compact among photosynthetic land plants. However, cpDNAs of the other two gnetophyte lineages (viz. Ephedrales and Gnetales) have not yet been studied. It remains unclear what underlining mechanisms have downsized the cpDNA. To pin down major factors for cpDNA reduction and compaction in gnetophytes, we have determined 4 complete cpDNAs, including one from each of the 3 gnetophyte orders, Ephedra equisetina, Gnetum parvifolium, and W. mirabilis, and one from the non-Pinus Pinaceae, Keteleeria davidiana. We report that the cpDNAs of E. equisetina (109,518bp) and G.parvifolium (114,914bp) are not only smaller but more compact than that of W. mirabilis (118,919bp). The gnetophyte cpDNAs have commonly lost at least 18 genes that are retained in other seed plants. Furthermore, they have significantly biased usages of AT-rich codons and shorter introns and intergenic spaces, which are largely due to more deletions at inter-operon than intra-operon spaces and removal of segment sequences rather than single-nucleotides. We show that the reduced gnetophyte cpDNAs clearly resulted from selection for economy by deletions of genes and non-coding sequences, which then led to the compactness and the accelerated substitution rates. The smallest C-values in gnetophyte nuclear DNAs and the competitive or resource-poor situations encountered by gnetophytes further suggest a critical need for an economic strategy.},

Gnetum comprises 25-35 species in South America, Africa, and Asia, of which we sampled 16, each with two to six clones. Criteria used to assess ITS functionality were highly divergent nucleotide substitution, GC content, secondary structure, and incongruent phylogenetic placement of presumed paralogs. The length of ITS1 ranged from 225 to 986 bp and that of ITS2 from 259 to 305 bp, the largest ranges so far reported from seed plants. Gnetum ITS1 contains two informative sequence motifs, but different from other gymnosperms, there are only few and short (7-13 bp) tandem repeats. Gnetum ITS2 contains two structural motifs, modified in different clades by shortening of stems and loops. Conspecific sequences grouped together except for two recombinant pseudogenes that had ITS1 of one clade and ITS2 of another. Most of the pseudogenic ITS copies, paralogs, and putative chimeras occurred in a clade that according to a fossil-calibrated chloroplast-DNA clock has an age of a few million years. Based on morphology and chromosome numbers, the most plausible causes of the observed high levels of ITS polymorphism are hybridization, allopolyploidy, and introgression.},

The only widespread species of the genus, Gisekia pharnaceoides, performs C4 photosynthesis based on CO2 compensation point measurements. This study investigates the C4 syndrome and its evolution in Gisekia. The infrageneric relationships, distribution and bioclimatic preferences of Gisekia are also investigated. METHODS Leaf gas exchange characteristics, activity of Rubisco and major C4 cycle enzymes, and ultrastructural characteristics of mesophyll and bundle sheath cells are studied for Gisekia pharnaceoides. δ(13)C values and leaf anatomy are analyzed for all species. A dated molecular phylogeny of 39 accessions representing all species of Gisekiaceae and 14 representatives of closely related core Caryophyllales families is generated using four cp markers and ITS. The precise current distribution and bioclimatic niche of Gisekia is assessed on the basis of 520 georeferenced specimen localities. KEY RESULTS All traditionally recognized species of Gisekia are C4 plants with atriplicoid Kranz anatomy. Gisekia pharnaceoides uses the NAD-ME biochemical type. The molecular phylogeny demonstrated two East African clades nested within South African clades, demonstrating migration along the arid areas of eastern Africa during the Late Miocene/Pliocene Epochs. Most traditionally defined species are polyphyletic. CONCLUSIONS Gisekia represents an isolated C4 lineage within core Caryophyllales dating back to the Miocene Epoch and probably spread along the African arid corridor from a South African center of origin. The seven currently recognized species should be treated as one polymorphic species or species complex, Gisekia pharnaceoides agg.},

The molecular developmental biology of floral symmetry has been examined recently in detail and several genes important in controlling floral symmetry in diverse Asteridae have been identified. One of the most important among these is the floral symmetry gene CYCLOIDEA (CYC). We compared GCYC (the Gesneriaceae homolog of CYC) sequences in Gesneriaceae genera with the typical bilaterally symmetric flowers and genera with radial or near radial symmetry. Parsimony, Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of GCYC sequences among members of Gesnerioideae are mostly congruent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses, but suggest two unexpected generic positions: Diastema as sister to Gesneria, and Bellonia within Gloxinieae. In order to evaluate whether these results might be artifactual we obtained new gene sequences from chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal regions. These data disagree with GCYC regarding the placement of Diastema, but agree with GCYC regarding Bellonia. We did not find any mutations in GCYC that could explain the shift in symmetry and there were no consistent differences in molecular evolution between taxa with bilaterally or radially symmetric flowers. Likewise taxa with radial floral symmetry are not sister to each other showing that the loss of bilateral symmetry has occurred multiple times in parallel. Further investigations of GCYC expression will be necessary to determine if any of these independent events involved changes in the regulation of GCYC.},

	abstract = {Speciation by hybridization has long been recognized among plants and includes both homoploid and allopolyploid speciation. The numbers of presumed hybrid species averages close to 11\% and tends to be concentrated in a subset of angiosperm families. Recent advances in molecular methods have verified species of hybrid origin that had been presumed on the basis of morphology and have identified species that were not initially considered hybrids. Identifying species of hybrid origin is often a challenge and typically based on intermediate morphology, or discrepancies between molecular datasets. Discrepancies between data partitions may result from several factors including poor support, incomplete lineage sorting, or hybridization. A phylogenetic analysis of species in Columnea (Gesneriaceae) indicated significant incongruencies between the cpDNA and nrDNA datasets. Tests that examined whether one or both of the datasets had the phylogenetic signal to reject the topology of the alternate dataset (Shimodaira and Hasegawa [SH] and approximately unbiased [AU] tests) indicated significant differences between the topologies. Splitstree analyses also showed that there was support for the placement of the discrepant taxa in both datasets and that the combined data placed the putative hybrid species in an intermediate position between the two datasets. The genealogical sorting index (GSI) implied that coalescence in nrDNA had occurred in all species where more than a single individual had been sampled, but the GSI value was lower for the cpDNA of most of the putative hybrids, implying that these regions have not yet coalesced in these lineages despite being haploid. The JML test that evaluates simulated species pairwise distances against observed distances also implies that observed nrDNA data generate shorter distances than simulated data, implying hybridization. It is most likely that C. gigantifolia, C. rubriacuta, and C. sp. nov. represent a lineage from a hybrid ancestor, but C. moorei may be a more recent hybrid and may still be undergoing hybridization with sympatric species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Major factors influencing the phenotypic diversity of a lineage can be recognized by characterizing the extent and mode of trait evolution between related species. Here, we compared the evolutionary dynamics of traits associated with floral morphology and climatic preferences in a clade composed of the genera Codonanthopsis, Codonanthe and Nematanthus (Gesneriaceae). To test the mode and specific components that lead to phenotypic diversity in this group, we performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of combined nuclear and plastid DNA sequences and modeled the evolution of quantitative traits related to flower shape and size and to climatic preferences. We propose an alternative approach to display graphically the complex dynamics of trait evolution along a phylogenetic tree using a wide range of evolutionary scenarios. RESULTS Our results demonstrated heterogeneous trait evolution. Floral shapes displaced into separate regimes selected by the different pollinator types (hummingbirds versus insects), while floral size underwent a clade-specific evolution. Rates of evolution were higher for the clade that is hummingbird pollinated and experienced flower resupination, compared with species pollinated by bees, suggesting a relevant role of plant-pollinator interactions in lowland rainforest. The evolution of temperature preferences is best explained by a model with distinct selective regimes between the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and the other biomes, whereas differentiation along the precipitation axis was characterized by higher rates, compared with temperature, and no regime or clade-specific patterns. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows different selective regimes and clade-specific patterns in the evolution of morphological and climatic components during the diversification of Neotropical species. Our new graphical visualization tool allows the representation of trait trajectories under parameter-rich models, thus contributing to a better understanding of complex evolutionary dynamics.},

The distributions of sister species pairs are compared and ancestral character states are reconstructed using Bayesian stochastic mapping. Climate variables were also assessed and shifts in ancestral climate conditions were mapped using SEEVA. The relationships between morphological character states and climate variables were assessed with correlation analyses. These results indicate that species in section Angustiflorae have likely diverged as a result of allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric speciation, with both biotic and abiotic forces driving morphological and phenological divergence.},

	abstract = {Resolving species relationships within recent radiations requires analysis at the interface of phylogenetics and population genetics, where coalescence and hybridization may confound our understanding of relationships. We developed 18 new primer pairs for nuclear loci in Cyrtandra (Gesneriaceae), one of the largest plant radiations in the Pacific Islands, and tested the concordance of 14 loci in establishing the phylogenetic relationships of a small number of Hawaiian species. Four genes yielded tree topologies conflicting with the primary concordance tree, suggesting plastid capture and horizontal transfer via hybridization. Combining all concordant genes yielded a tree with stronger support and a different topology from the total-evidence tree. We conclude that a small number of genes may be insufficient for accurate reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationships among closely related species. Further, the combination of genes for phylogenetic analysis without preliminary concordance tests can yield an erroneous tree topology. It seems that the number of genes needed for phylogenetic analysis of closely related species is significantly greater than the small numbers commonly used, which fail to isolate coalescence, introgression and hybridization.},

	abstract = {The geographical pattern of speciation and the relationship between floral variation and species ranges were investigated in the tribe Sinningieae (Gesneriaceae), which is found mainly in the Atlantic forests of Brazil. Geographical distribution data recorded on a grid system of 0.5 x 0.5 degree intervals and a near-complete species-level phylogenetic tree of Sinningieae inferred from a simultaneous analysis of seven DNA regions were used to address the role of geographical isolation in speciation. Geographical range overlaps between sister lineages were measured across all nodes in the phylogenetic tree and analyzed in relation to relative ages estimated from branch lengths. Although there are several cases of species sympatry in Sinningieae, patterns of sympatry between sister taxa support the predominance of allopatric speciation. The pattern of sympatry between sister taxa is consistent with range shifts following allopatric speciation, except in one clade, in which the overlapping distribution of recent sister species indicates speciation within a restricted geographical area and involving changes in pollinators and habitats. The relationship between floral divergence and regional sympatry was also examined by analyzing floral contrasts, phenological overlap, and the degree of sympatry between sister clades. Morphological contrast between flowers is not increased in sympatry and phenological divergence is more apparent between allopatric clades than between sympatric clades. Therefore, our results failed to indicate a tendency for sympatric taxa to minimize morphological and phenological overlap (geographic exclusion and/or character displacement hypotheses). Instead, they point toward adaptation in phenology to local conditions and buildup of sympatries at random with respect to flower morphology. Additional studies at a lower geographical scale are needed to identify truely coexisting species and the components of their reproductive isolation.},

We attempt to resolve their hitherto poorly understood generic relationships using three molecular markers on 145 species, of which 128 belong to didymocarpoid Gesneriaceae. Our analyses demonstrate that consistent topological relationships can be retrieved from data sets with missing data using subsamples and different combinations of gene sequences. We show that all available classifications in Old World Gesneriaceae are artificial and do not reflect natural relationships. At the base of the didymocarpoids are grades of clades comprising isolated genera and small groups from Asia and Europe. These are followed by a clade comprising the African and Madagascan genera. The remaining clades represent the advanced Asiatic and Malesian genera. They include a major group with mostly twisted capsules. The much larger group of remaining genera comprises exclusively genera with straight capsules and the huge genus Cyrtandra with indehiscent fruits. Several genera such as Briggsia, Henckelia, and Chirita are not monophyletic; Chirita is even distributed throughout five clades. This degree of incongruence between molecular phylogenies, traditional classifications, and generic delimitations indicates the problems with classifications based on, sometimes a single, morphological characters.},

	abstract = {The genus Cyrtandra is the largest in the Gesneriaceae family and is one of the most widely dispersed plant genera in southeast Asia and the Pacific. Species of Cyrtandra are morphologically diverse but characters are often homoplastic causing considerable difficulty in defining monophyletic classification units. In this study, we used molecular phylogenetic analysis of 88 taxa representing approximately 70 species to construct a well-resolved evolutionary hypothesis for Cyrtandra. Diversification rates analysis and ancestral range analysis were also conducted to infer timing of major lineage divergences and geographic origin of these lineages, principally among Pacific species. Using these data, we compared existing classification schemes to better understand the applicability of current taxonomy. Divergence time estimates support a diversification of the Pacific clade at approximately 20 MYBP. Although the origin of the Pacific lineage remains unresolved, ancestral range reconstruction analysis supports Fiji as the most likely "first-step" into the Pacific with subsequent dispersals to Hawai'i, and other archipelagos. A greater Fiji-Samoa region, corresponding with Takhtajan's Fijian Region, is implicated as a major Pacific region interface and possibly a center of origin for expansion of Cyrtandra throughout the Pacific. Among South Pacific taxa sampled, several supported clades in our evolutionary hypothesis are characterized by distinct morphological traits possibly warranting sectional rankings. Relationships among Hawaiian taxa are less resolved and the distributions of species within this clade do not consistently correspond to existing sectional rankings. More detailed, population-level research is needed to clarify these relationships. We argue that future sectional classifications should correspond with monophyletic lineages and that species-level relationships should be more closely studied within these lineages.},

The results confirmed the monophyly of three major clades and four subclades within Pelargonium but also indicate the need to revise some sectional classifications. This phylogeny was used to examine karyotype evolution in the genus: plotting chromosome sizes, numbers and 2C-values indicates that genome size is significantly correlated with chromosome size but not number. Accelerated rates of nucleotide substitution have been previously detected in both plastid and mitochondrial genes in Pelargonium, but sparse taxon sampling did not enable identification of the phylogenetic distribution of these elevated rates. Using the multigene phylogeny as a constraint, we investigated lineage- and locus-specific heterogeneity of substitution rates in Pelargonium for an expanded number of taxa and demonstrated that both plastid and mitochondrial genes have had accelerated substitution rates but with markedly disparate patterns. In the plastid, the exons of rpoC1 have significantly accelerated substitution rates compared to its intron and the acceleration was mainly due to nonsynonymous substitutions. In contrast, the mitochondrial gene, nad5, experienced substantial acceleration of synonymous substitution rates in three internal branches of Pelargonium, but this acceleration ceased in all terminal branches. Several lineages also have dN/dS ratios significantly greater than one for rpoC1, indicating that positive selection is acting on this gene, whereas the accelerated synonymous substitutions in the mitochondrial gene are the result of elevated mutation rates.},

	abstract = {The cosmopolitan genus Geranium L. (Geraniaceae) consists of c. 350 species distributed in temperate habitats worldwide, with most of its diversity concentrated in the Mediterranean region. Unlike other genera in Geraniaceae, the species of Geranium present contrasting seed discharge syndromes, i.e. the 'Erodium-type' (ET), the 'carpel-projection type' (CP), the 'seed-ejection type' (SE), and the 'inoperative type' (IT), which have been used to delimit major groups within the genus. However, phylogenetic relationships within Geranium are unknown and so is the evolution of the different seed discharge mechanisms. Here, we used a calibrated multispecies coalescent approach to infer the species-level phylogeny and divergence times of the genus based on chloroplast (rbcL, trnL-trnF) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences. Our sampling represents most of the morphological variation described in the genus. We reconstruct the evolution of the seed discharge mechanism using ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) techniques on the multispecies coalescent tree, and assess the association between fruit type evolution and species diversification using stochastic birth-death and trait-dependent diversification models. Finally, we reconstruct the early biogeographic history of the genus using discrete and continuous biogeographic analyses of species distribution centroids, including fossil evidence and tip dates. Our results show that fruit type is homoplasious and that the classification based on fruit type in Geranium is artificial. The taxonomy and putative apomorphic characters for Geranium are discussed. ASR of the fruit characters suggests that ET may represent the ancestral state in Geranium and from which CP originated twice, IT presumably once, and SE twice. The independent appearance of the SE syndrome is in both cases associated with increases in diversification rates in the genus. The biogeographic analysis centers the origin and early 10Ma diversification of Geranium on the Mediterranean region. The evolution of seed discharge mechanism about 5Ma might have allowed the species of Geranium to increase in geographic range and to ultimately, diversify.},

As with all complex structures, individual elements of a leaf could theoretically evolve independently and at different rates to the extent permitted by genetic and functional limitations. We examined relative evolutionary lability of shape-determining elements in the highly diverse South African plant genus Pelargonium (Geraniaceae). We used SIMMAP to calculate Bayesian posterior probabilities for ancestral states of leaf-shape characters for major nodes across multiple phylogenetic trees. Trees were derived from a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data from four partitions. We found that shape elements differed in rates of character-state transformations across the tree. Leaf base, apex, and overall outline had low rates. Transformations in venation occurred at slightly higher rates and were associated with shifts in venation among major clades. Leaf margin type and overall leaf size showed intermediate rates, whereas high rates were observed in the extent of lamina lobing and functional leaf size. The results indicate that suites of elements characteristic of the recently evolved xerophytic lineage, for example pinnate venation, dissected lamina, and entire margins, were acquired piecemeal over nested levels of the phylogeny.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The genus Erodium is a common feature of Mediterranean-type climates throughout the world, but the Mediterranean Basin has significantly higher diversity than other areas. The aim here is to reveal the biogeographical history of the genus and the causes behind the evolution of the uneven distribution. METHODS Seventy-eight new nrITS sequences were incorporated with existing plastid data to explore the phylogenetic relationships and biogeography of Erodium using several reconstruction methods. Divergence times for major clades were calculated and contrasted with other previously published information. Furthermore, topological and temporal diversification rate shift analyses were employed using these data. KEY RESULTS Phylogenetic relationships among species are widely congruent with previous plastid reconstructions, which refute the classical taxonomical classification. Biogeographical reconstructions point to Asia as the ancestral area of Erodium, arising approx. 18 MYA. Four incidences of intercontinental dispersal from the Mediterranean Basin to similar climates are demonstrated. Increases in diversification were present in two independent Erodium lineages concurrently. Two bursts of diversification (3 MYA and 0·69 MYA) were detected only in the Mediterranean flora. CONCLUSIONS Two lineages diverged early in the evolution of the genus Erodium: (1) subgenus Erodium plus subgenus Barbata subsection Absinthioidea and (2) the remainder of subgenus Barbata. Dispersal across major water bodies, although uncommon, has had a major influence on the distribution of this genus and is likely to have played as significant role as in other, more easily dispersed, genera. Establishment of Mediterranean climates has facilitated the spread of the genus and been crucial in its diversification. Two, independent, rapid radiations in response to the onset of drought and glacial climate change indicate putative adaptive radiations in the genus.},

	doi = {10.1080/10635150590905867},
	abstract = {Disjunctive distributions across paleotropical regions in the Indian Ocean Basin (IOB) often invoke dispersal/vicariance debates. Exacum (Gentianaceae, tribe Exaceae) species are spread around the IOB, in Africa, Madagascar, Socotra, the Arabian peninsula, Sri Lanka, India, the Himalayas, mainland Southeast Asia including southern China and Malaysia, and northern Australia. The distribution of this genus was suggested to be a typical example of vicariance resulting from the breakup of the Gondwanan supercontinent. The molecular phylogeny of Exacum is in principle congruent with morphological conclusions and shows a pattern that resembles a vicariance scenario with rapid divergence among lineages, but our molecular dating analysis demonstrates that the radiation is too recent to be associated with the Gondwanan continental breakup. We used our dating analysis to test the results of DIVA and found that the program predicted impossible vicariance events. Ancestral area reconstruction suggests that Exacum originated in Madagascar, and divergence dating suggests its origin was not before the Eocene. The Madagascan progenitor, the most recent common ancestor of Exacum, colonized Sri Lanka and southern India via long-distance dispersals. This colonizer underwent an extensive range expansion and spread to Socotra-Arabia, northern India, and mainland Southeast Asia in the northern IOB when it was warm and humid in these regions. This widespread common ancestor retreated subsequently from most parts of these regions and survived in isolation in Socotra-Arabia, southern India-Sri Lanka, and perhaps mainland Southeast Asia, possibly as a consequence of drastic climatic changes, particularly the spreading drought during the Neogene. Secondary diversification from these surviving centers and Madagascar resulted in the extant main lineages of the genus. The vicariance-like pattern shown by the phylogeny appears to have resulted from long-distance dispersals followed by extensive range expansion and subsequent fragmentation. The extant African species E. oldenlandioides is confirmed to be recently dispersed from Madagascar.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The angiosperm family Gentianaceae comprises over 1700 species in 91 genera. Gentianaceae are distributed worldwide, but most species occur in temperate zones. Phylogenetic studies demonstrate that the family consists of six monophyletic tribes. However, the phylogenetic position of the mycoheterotrophic genus Voyria, with a remarkable trans-Atlantic distribution, remained unknown. METHODS We used nuclear ITS and 18S rDNA and mitochondrial apt1 and matR data to infer the phylogenetic position of Voyria in Gentianaceae. In addition, with Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses we obtained age estimates for the diversification of Voyria and Gentianaceae in general and used these results to reconstruct the ancestral areas associated with the early diversification events in Gentianaceae. KEY RESULTS Our results demonstrate that Voyria is an early diverging lineage within Gentianaceae with no close relationships to other mycoheterotrophic Gentianaceae lineages. Voyria originated in the neotropics during the Early Eocene but only reached its current transoceanic distribution around the end of the Oligocene. The neotropics were an important area for the early diversification events in Gentianaceae, most of which occurred during the Eocene. CONCLUSIONS Voyria is an old, phylogenetically isolated lineage within Gentianaceae, and the current distribution of the genus is indicative of the ancestral area in which the early diversification events of Gentianaceae occurred. In parallel with many other pantropical families, our results suggest that migration of tropical taxa through Laurasia during the Early Eocene has played an important role in shaping the current global distribution of Gentianaceae.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Geological and climatic changes associated with the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) have been suggested as drivers for biological diversification locally and in neighboring regions. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the niche evolution of Tripterospermum (Gentianaceae) and related Asian genera through time. METHODS We conducted Species Distribution Modeling using Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt). Furthermore, we performed stochastic character mapping and produced disparity-through-time plots, and examined putative key innovations using the binary state speciation and extinction approach (BISSE). KEY RESULTS Kuepferia and Sinogentiana prefer the coolest and driest habitat, having rather conserved niches. Despite a tendency for niche evolution, Crawfurdia and Metagentiana are probably restricted to a narrow distribution range because of their poor dispersal ability. In contrast, Tripterospermum has the broadest niche and occurs under the warmest and wettest conditions. A higher degree of niche evolution and a more efficient dispersal mechanism allowed this genus to diversify more and occupy a broader distribution range. CONCLUSIONS The QTP genera producing dry capsules, whether displaying niche conservatism (Kuepferia and Sinogentiana) or a tendency for niche evolution (Crawfurdia and Metagentiana), are less species-rich and have a more restricted distribution than Tripterospermum (stronger niche evolution and berry-like fruits). The evolution of berry-like fruits corresponds to increased speciation rates, and could therefore be viewed as a key innovation. In contrast to the majority of studies on plants occurring around the QTP, we find that speciation was probably mediated by niche breadth and dispersal ability rather than geophysical changes.},

In addition, morphological, palynological, and phytochemical characters were included to a combined data matrix to detect possible non-molecular synapomorphies. Phylogenetic reconstructions support the monophyly of the Chironiinae and an age estimate of ca. 22 million years for the subtribe. Conversely, both molecular data sets reveal a polyphyletic Centaurium, with four well-supported main clades hereafter treated as separate genera. The primarily Mediterranean Centaurium s.s. is closely related to southern African endemics Chironia and Orphium, and to the Chilean species Centaurium cachanlahuen. The resurrected Mexican and Central American genus Gyrandra is closely related to Sabatia (from eastern North America). Lastly, the monospecific genus Exaculum (Mediterranean) forms a monophyletic group together with the two new genera: Schenkia (Mediterranean and Australian species) and Zeltnera (all other indigenous American centauries). Several biogeographical patterns can be inferred for this group, supporting a Mediterranean origin followed by dispersals to (1) North America, Central America, and South America, (2) southern Africa (including the Cape region), and (3) Australia and Pacific Islands.},

	abstract = {Within the Gentianaceae-Exaceae, the most species-rich genus Sebaea has received very little attention in terms of phylogenetic or karyological investigations. As a result, the exact number of species remains vague and the relationships with the other members of the Exaceae poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive phylogeny of the Exaceae including most Sebaea species known so far based on four cpDNA sequence regions. In addition, morphological and karyological characters were mapped on the inferred phylogenetic trees to detect possible non-molecular synapomorphies. Our results reveal the paraphyly of Sebaea and highlight new generic relationships within the Exaceae. Sebaea pusilla (lineage S1--Lagenias) forms a highly supported and early diverging clade with Sebaeas.str. (clade S2 -Sebaea). A third clade of the former Sebaea s.l. (clade S3--Exochaenium) contains exclusively tropical African species, and is sister with a large clade containing all the remaining genera of Exaceae. Within the latter, the proposed sister relationships between the recently described Klackenbergia and Ornichia are highly supported. Optimization of several morphological characters onto the inferred phylogenetic trees reveals several synapomorphies for most highly supported clades. In particular, lineage S1 (Lagenias) is supported by medifixed anthers that are inserted at the base of the corolla tube and cubical seeds with polygonal testa cells; clade S2 (Sebaea) is supported by both the presence of secondary stigmas along the style and ridged seeds with rectangular testa cells arranged in row; clade S3 (Exochaenium) is supported by its particular gynoecium (stylar polymorphism and clavate, papillose stigma). Finally, karyological reconstructions suggest a basal number of x=7 for the Exaceae and several episodes of dysploidy leading to x=8 and 9.},

A total of 515 individuals from 183 populations over the entire Ciminalis distribution range was analyzed using four chloroplast loci (trnH-psbA, matK, rpoB and rpoC1) and the nuclear ribosomal marker ITS2. The siliceous species display only two chloroplast haplotypes each and are both characterized by patterns of range expansions all over the Alps. Conversely, the calcareous species are on average more diverse (two to 13 haplotypes per species) with strong patterns of local structuring. We suggest that the occurrence of many calcareous refugia at the periphery of the Alps must have led to local adaptation and morphological diversification, and helped preserving intraspecific diversities during the last glaciations for the associated taxa. ITS2 was more efficient in delineating species boundaries than the chloroplast markers for which several haplotypes are shared among species. This might be either due to chloroplast capture among species and/or to recent divergence. Species adapted to the same substrate are generally only distantly related when they co-occur in the same place. For both types of markers, G. clusii is found genetically distant from all other species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The systematic position of the genus Metagentiana and its phylogenetic relationships with Crawfurdia, Gentiana and Tripterospermum have not been explicitly addressed. These four genera belong to one of two subtribes (Gentianinae) of Gentianeae. The aim of this paper is to examine the systematic position of Crawfurdia, Metagentiana and Tripterospermum and to clarify their phylogenetic affinities more clearly using ITS and trnL intron sequences. METHODS Nucleotide sequences from the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the plastid DNA trnL (UAA) intron were analysed phylogenetically. Ten of fourteen Metagentiana species were sampled, together with 40 species of other genera in the subtribe Gentianinae. KEY RESULTS The data support several previously published conclusions relating to the separation of Metagentiana from Gentiana and its closer relationships to Crawfurdia and Tripterospermum based on studies of gross morphology, floral anatomy, chromosomes, palynology, embryology and previous molecular data. The molecular clock hypothesis for the tested sequences in subtribe Gentianinae was not supported by the data (P {\textless} 0.05), so the clock-independent non-parametric rate smoothing method was used to estimate divergence time. This indicates that the separation of Crawfurdia, Metagentiana and Tripterospermum from Gentiana occurred about 11.4-21.4 Mya (million years ago), and the current species of these three genera diverged at times ranging from 0.4 to 6.2 Mya. CONCLUSIONS The molecular analyses revealed that Crawfurdia, Metagentiana and Tripterospermum do not merit status as three separate genera, because sampled species of Crawfurdia and Tripterospermum are embedded within Metagentiana. The speciation and rapid radiation of these three genera is likely to have occurred in western China as a result of upthrust of the Himalayas during the late Miocene and the Pleistocene.},

	abstract = {The monophyletic and Neotropical tribe Helieae of the worldwide family Gentianaceae (Gentianales, Asterids, Angiospermae) is well known for its problematic generic classifications. An initial phylogenetic analysis of Helieae shed light onto the relationships between genera, and indicated that traditional generic limits did not correspond to monophyletic groups. In order to obtain a more thorough understanding of generic relationships within the group, we enhanced sampling within the so-called Symbolanthus clade and performed phylogenetic analyses from DNA sequences from one plastid region (matK) and two nuclear regions (ITS and 5S-NTS), plus 112 morphological characters, which were analyzed separately and in combination, using parsimony and Bayesian approaches. A total of 83 individuals representing 20 genera and 51 species of Helieae were sampled; 13 species were included in this study solely based on their morphological characters. Ancestral character reconstructions were performed to identify potential synapomorphies of clades and patterns of homoplasy in the morphological dataset. Our results demonstrate that Prepusa is sister to the remainder of Helieae. Furthermore, the Macrocarpaea clade, the Irlbachia clade and the Symbolanthus clade were also recovered. Within the Symbolanthus clade, our results confirm that Calolisianthus and Chelonanthus are not monophyletic, and also contest the monophyly of Irlbachia as currently circumscribed. Specifically, two species of Calolisianthus group with the type species of Chelonanthus, while the other Calolisianthus species are more closely related to Tetrapollinia and Symbolanthus. Moreover, the green-white-flowered Chelonanthus species and Adenolisianthus are undoubtedly related to Helia and several analyses support Irlbachia pratensis as more closely related to the lineage including the type species of Chelonanthus described above The addition of new characters and taxa led to higher confidence in the relative position of some clades, as well as provided further support for a new generic circumscription of Calolisianthus, Chelonanthus, and Helia. Even though several morphological characters traditionally used in the taxonomy of the group were shown to be homoplasious, most clades can be diagnosed by a combination of morphological character states.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Fumarioideae (20 genera, 593 species) is a clade of Papaveraceae (Ranunculales) characterized by flowers that are either disymmetric (i.e. two perpendicular planes of bilateral symmetry) or zygomorphic (i.e. one plane of bilateral symmetry). In contrast, the other subfamily of Papaveraceae, Papaveroideae (23 genera, 230 species), has actinomorphic flowers (i.e. more than two planes of symmetry). Understanding of the evolution of floral symmetry in this clade has so far been limited by the lack of a reliable phylogenetic framework. Pteridophyllum (one species) shares similarities with Fumarioideae but has actinomorphic flowers, and the relationships among Pteridophyllum, Papaveroideae and Fumarioideae have remained unclear. This study reassesses the evolution of floral symmetry in Papaveraceae based on new molecular phylogenetic analyses of the family. METHODS Maximum likelihood, Bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses of Papaveraceae were conducted using six plastid markers and one nuclear marker, sampling Pteridophyllum, 18 (90 \%) genera and 73 species of Fumarioideae, 11 (48 \%) genera and 11 species of Papaveroideae, and a wide selection of outgroup taxa. Floral characters recorded from the literature were then optimized onto phylogenetic trees to reconstruct ancestral states using parsimony, maximum likelihood and reversible-jump Bayesian approaches. KEY RESULTS Pteridophyllum is not nested in Fumarioideae. Fumarioideae are monophyletic and Hypecoum (18 species) is the sister group of the remaining genera. Relationships within the core Fumarioideae are well resolved and supported. Dactylicapnos and all zygomorphic genera form a well-supported clade nested among disymmetric taxa. CONCLUSIONS Disymmetry of the corolla is a synapomorphy of Fumarioideae and is strongly correlated with changes in the androecium and differentiation of middle and inner tepal shape (basal spurs on middle tepals). Zygomorphy subsequently evolved from disymmetry either once (with a reversal in Dactylicapnos) or twice (Capnoides, other zygomorphic Fumarioideae) and appears to be correlated with the loss of one nectar spur.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Little research has been done at the molecular level on the tribe Fumarieae (Papaveraceae). Papaveraceae is a model plant group for studying evolutionary patterns despite the lack of a reference phylogeny for this tribe. We investigated the phylogenetic relationships within the tribe to complete the molecular data for this family in order to help understand its character evolution and biogeographic pattern. METHODS We used maximum-parsimony and Bayesian approaches to analyze five DNA regions for 25 species representing 10 of the 11 Fumarieae genera and five outgroups. Evolutionary pathways of four characters (habit, life span, type of fruit, and number of seeds per fruit) were inferred on the phylogeny using parsimony. The ancestral distribution areas were reconstructed using dispersal-vicariance analysis. KEY RESULTS Fumarieae is monophyletic and includes three groups that agree with the morphology-based subtribes: Discocapninae, Fumariinae, and Sarcocapninae. Within subtribes, the relationships among genera were different from those obtained with morphological data. Annual life span, nonchasmophytic habit, and a several-seeded capsule were the basal character states for the tribe. The ancestor occupied a continuous area between West Eurasia and Africa. Vicariances explain the divergence between lineages Discocapninae (South Africa) and Fumariinae-Sarcocapninae (Mediterranean), and the disjunction of Fumariinae (Mediterranean-Central Asia). CONCLUSIONS Molecular phylogeny confirms the subtribal classification of Fumarieae based on morphology. However it provides different results regarding the relationships among genera within each subtribe, which affects the inference of the evolutionary pathway followed by the four selected characters. The disjunct distribution of the tribe is explained by different vicariance scenarios.},

However, the phylogeny of the entire Fumarioideae subfamily is not totally known. In this work, we infer a molecular phylogeny of Fumarioideae, which we use to interpret the biogeographical patterns in the subfamily and to establish biogeographical links between floristic regions, such as those suggested by its different inter- and intra-continental disjunctions. The tribe Hypecoeae is the sister group of tribe Fumarieae, this latter holding a basal grade of monotypic or few-species genera with bisymmetric flowers, and a core group, Core Fumarieae, of more specious rich genera with zygomorphic flowers. The biogeographical analysis shows a subfamily that originated in East Asia at the end of the Early Cretaceous. From here, ancestral range expansions followed three different directions, one at the beginning of the Late Cretaceous by the ancestor of tribe Hypecoeae towards central Asia, and two during the Cretaceous-Palaeogene transition towards western North America and Indochina by the ancestor of the tribe Fumarieae. The ancestor of Core Fumarieae expanded its range from East Asia into the Himalayas before to the middle Eocene. The uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau together with the zonal climate pattern of the Palaeogene are suggested to be responsible both for the accelerated diversification rate resulting in the origin of the basal lineages of Core Fumarieae as well as for the westward migration of the ancestor of Fumarieae s.str. into the Irano-Turanian region. From here, this latter group reached South Africa during late Eocene and Mediterranean basin during Oligocene. There were two colonization waves of the Mediterranean following two different routes: a northern route during the early Oligocene by the subtribe Sarcocapninae, probably facilitated by the land bridge resulting of the Mediterranean microplate accretion; and a southern route into North Africa, through the Gomphotherium land bridge, taken by the subtribe Fumariinae between late Oligocene and middle Miocene.},

Zygomorphy evolved once in the subfamily Fumarioideae from a disymmetric state. Unusual within angiosperms, zygomorphy takes place along the transverse plane of the flower. METHODS We investigated floral development to understand the developmental bases of the evolution of floral symmetry in Papaveraceae. We then assessed the expression of candidate genes for the key developmental events responsible for the shift from disymmetry to transverse zygomorphy, namely CrabsClaw for nectary formation (PapCRC), ShootMeristemless (PapSTL) for spur formation, and Cycloidea (PapCYL) for growth control. KEY RESULTS We found that an early disymmetric groundplan is common to all species studied, and that actinomorphy was acquired after sepal initiation in Papaveroideae. The shift from disymmetry to zygomorphy in Fumarioideae was associated with early asymmetric growth of stamen filaments, followed by asymmetric development of nectary outgrowth and spur along the transverse plane. Patterns of PapSTL expression could not be clearly related to spur formation. PapCRC and PapCYL genes were expressed in the nectary outgrowths, with a pattern of expression correlated with asymmetric nectary development in the zygomorphic species. Additionally, PapCYL genes were found asymmetrically expressed along the transverse plane in the basal region of outer petals in the zygomorphic species. CONCLUSION Genes of PapCRC and PapCYL families could be direct or indirect targets of the initial transversally asymmetric cue responsible for the shift from disymmetry to zygomorphy in Fumarioideae.},

	volume = {64},
	doi = {10.1093/sysbio/syv004},
	abstract = {There is a rising awareness that species trees are best inferred from multiple loci while taking into account processes affecting individual gene trees, such as substitution model error (failure of the model to account for the complexity of the data) and coalescent stochasticity (presence of incomplete lineage sorting [ILS]). Although most studies have been carried out in the context of dichotomous species trees, these processes operate also in more complex evolutionary histories involving multiple hybridizations and polyploidy. Recently, methods have been developed that accurately handle ILS in allopolyploids, but they are thus far restricted to networks of diploids and tetraploids. We propose a procedure that improves on this limitation by designing a workflow that assigns homoeologs to hypothetical diploid ancestral genomes prior to genome tree construction. Conflicting assignment hypotheses are evaluated against substitution model error and coalescent stochasticity. Incongruence that cannot be explained by stochastic mechanisms needs to be explained by other processes (e.g., homoploid hybridization or paralogy). The data can then be filtered to build multilabeled genome phylogenies using inference methods that can recover species trees, either in the face of substitution model error and coalescent stochasticity alone, or while simultaneously accounting for hybridization. Methods are already available for folding the resulting multilabeled genome phylogeny into a network. We apply the workflow to the reconstruction of the reticulate phylogeny of the plant genus Fumaria (Papaveraceae) with ploidal levels ranging from 2[Formula: see text] to 14[Formula: see text]. We describe the challenges in recovering nuclear NRPB2 homoeologs in high ploidy species while combining in vivo cloning and direct sequencing techniques. Using parametric bootstrapping simulations we assign nuclear homoeologs and chloroplast sequences (four concatenated loci) to their common hypothetical diploid ancestral genomes. As these assignments hinge on effective population size assumptions, we investigate how varying these assumptions impacts the recovered multilabeled genome phylogeny.},

To understand some of the evolutionary processes underlying the speciation of lineages in the Mexican Deserts, the diversification of Fouquieria is investigated, which includes eleven species, all endemic to the warm deserts and dry subtropical regions of North America. Using a phylogeny from plastid DNA sequences with samples of individuals from populations of all the species recognized in Fouquieria, we estimate divergence times, test for temporal diversification heterogeneity, test for geographical structure, and conduct ancestral area reconstruction. Fouquieria is an ancient lineage that diverged from Polemoniaceae ca. 75.54 Ma. A Mio-Pliocene diversification of Fouquieria with vicariance, associated with Neogene orogenesis underlying the early development of regional deserts is strongly supported. Test for temporal diversification heterogeneity indicates that during its evolutionary history, Fouquieria had a drastic diversification rate shift at ca.12.72 Ma, agreeing with hypotheses that some of the lineages in North American deserts diversified as early as the late Miocene to Pliocene, and not during the Pleistocene. Long-term diversification dynamics analyses suggest that extinction also played a significant role in Fouquieria's evolution, with a very high rate at the onset of the process. From the late Miocene onwards, Fouquieria underwent substantial diversification change, involving high speciation decreasing to the present and negligible extinction, which is congruent with its scant fossil record during this period. Geographic phylogenetic structure and the pattern of most sister species inhabiting different desert nucleus support that isolation by distance could be the main driver of speciation.},

Over the past 30 years, several prominent hypotheses have predicted the association of plant defenses with particular abiotic environments or geographic regions. We used a strongly supported phylogeny of oaks to test whether defensive traits of 56 oak species are associated with particular components of their climatic niche. Climate predicted both the chemical leaf defenses and the physical leaf defenses of oaks, whether analyzed separately or in combination. Oak leaf defenses were higher at lower latitudes, and this latitudinal gradient could be explained entirely by climate. Using phylogenetic regression methods, we found that plant defenses tended to be greater in oak species that occur in regions with low temperature seasonality, mild winters, and low minimum precipitation, and that plant defenses may track the abiotic environment slowly over macroevolutionary time. The pattern of association we observed between oak leaf traits and abiotic environments was consistent with a combination of a seasonality gradient, which may relate to different herbivore pressures, and the resource availability hypothesis, which posits that herbivores exert greater selection on plants in resource-limited abiotic environments.},

To infer phylogenetic relationships within Quercus subgenus Quercus, chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) restriction sites and nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and the 5.8S coding region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat were obtained for 44 individuals, including 25 species, intraspecific samples, and three outgroups. Separate parsimony analyses of each data set showed that individual gene trees were congruent and often complementary in supporting clades that generally corresponded to previously recognized taxonomic groups. Only one instance of strongly supported gene tree incongruence was detected and this anomalous pattern was explained best by ancient introgression of cpDNA across sectional boundaries. Simultaneous parsimony analysis of the pruned data sets supported the recognition of the strictly Eurasian section Cerris and resolved a novel hypothesis for the major infrageneric groups (Cerris- (Lobatae- (Protobalanus + Quercus sensu stricto))). The biogeographic hypothesis that all major oak lineages evolved locally at middle latitudes within the general distribution of their fossil ancestors was fully supported. This set of relationships also suggested a New World origin for the widespread white oaks of the Northern Hemisphere (section Quercus s. s.). For both data sets, inter- and intraspecific sampling within section Protobalanus showed little correspondence to morphological species. Greater cladistic structure among the samples was obtained by cpDNA restriction sites and two well-delimited plastomes types comprising a total of 15 distinct haplotypes were resolved. Haplotypes of 2 of the peripheral species in this species complex occupy terminal portions of one of the plastome clades, suggesting a more recent origin relative to those of more widespread species. The phylogeography of the two divergent plastome types suggested a north-south pattern, consistent with a Late Tertiary disjunction in the ancestral distribution of section Protobalanus.},

In this study, we reconstruct the first comprehensive phylogeny of this lineage using a genomic approach (restriction-site associated DNA sequencing, RAD-seq), sampling 35 of the ca. 90 species currently recognized, representing all main morphological groups of section Cyclobalanopsis. In addition, 10 other species of Quercus and two outgroups were also sampled. Divergence times were estimated using a relaxed clock model and two fossil calibrations. Ancestral areas and dispersal routes were inferred using statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis and the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model. The phylogeny of Quercus section Cyclobalanopsis demonstrates the section to be monophyletic, comprising two main lineages and six subclades that are well supported by anatomical traits. Biogeographical reconstructions indicate that the wide northern hemisphere distribution of Quercus was disrupted in the Late Eocene, leading to the main extant groups at about 33 Ma. The earliest divergences in section Cyclobalanopsis correspond to the phased uplift of the Himalayas and lateral extrusion of Indochina at the transition of the Oligocene and Miocene, where the highest rate of diversification occurred in the late Miocene. Dispersal from Sino-Himalaya and the Palaeotropics to Sino-Japan in the Miocene was facilitated by the increased intensity of East Asian summer monsoons and by the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum. Our results highlight the importance of climatic changes and Indo-Eurasian collision-induced tectonic activities from the Neogene onward to the spatial-temporal diversification patterns of Asian EBLF lineages.},

We used this data set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among Medicago species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the data supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships estimated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of Medicago.},

All analyses yielded consistent relationships among major lineages. Our results suggested that Campylotropis, Kummerowia, and Lespedeza are monophyletic, respectively. Lespedeza is resolved as sister to Kummerowia and these two together are further sister to Campylotropis. Neither of the two subgenera, subgen. Lespedeza and subgen. Macrolespedeza, in Lespedeza based on morphological characters, is recovered as monophyletic. Within Lespedeza, the North American clade is retrieved as sister to the Asian clade. The nuclear and chloroplast markers showed incongruent phylogenetic signals at shallow-level phylogeny, which may point to either introgression or incomplete lineage sorting in Lespedeza. The divergence times within Lespedeza and among related genera were estimated using Bayesian approach with BEAST. It is assumed that following the divergence between Kummerowia and Lespedeza in Asia in the late Miocene, the ancestor of Lespedeza diverged into the North American and the Asian lineages. The North American ancestor quickly migrated to North America through the Bering land bridge in the late Miocene. The North American and Asian lineages started to diversify almost simultaneously in the late Miocene but resulted in biased numbers of species in two continents.},

These two genera have confusing relationships based on morphology; therefore, we aimed to provide a clear understanding of their phylogenetic and biogeographic evolution within eastern Asia. In our investigations we included 88 samples representing five Gueldenstaedtia species, five Tibetia species, and outgroup species were sequenced using five markers (nuclear: ITS; chloroplast: matK, trnL-F, psbA-trnH and rbcL). Our phylogenetic results support (1) the monophyly of Tibetia and of Gueldenstaedtia, respectively; and (2) that Tibetia and Gueldenstaedtia are sister genera. Additionally, our data identified that Tibetia species had much higher sequence variation than Gueldenstaedtia species. Our results suggest that the two genera were separated from each other about 17.23 million years ago, which is congruent with the Himalayan orogeny and the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau in the mid Miocene. The divergence of Tibetia and Gueldenstaedtia is strongly supported by the separation of the Sino-Himalayan and Sino-Japanese region within eastern Asia. In addition, the habitat heterogeneity may accelerate the molecular divergence of Tibetia in the Sino-Himalayan region.},

However, the integration of these types of data for large scale phylogenetic studies has rarely been investigated. Here we conduct a phylogenetic analysis of the whole chloroplast genome and two nuclear ribosomal loci for 65 Acacia species from across the most recent Acacia phylogeny. We then combine this data with previously generated amplicon sequences (four chloroplast loci and two nuclear ribosomal loci) for 508 Acacia species. We use several phylogenetic methods, including maximum likelihood bootstrapping (with and without constraint) and ExaBayes, in order to determine the success of combining a dataset of 4000bp with one of 189,000bp. The results of our study indicate that the inclusion of whole genome data gave a far better resolved and well supported representation of the phylogenetic relationships within Acacia than using only amplicon sequences, with the greatest support observed when using a whole genome phylogeny as a constraint on the amplicon sequences. Our study therefore provides methods for optimal integration of genomic and amplicon sequences.},

	abstract = {Tropical rain forests support a remarkable diversity of tree species, questioning how and when this diversity arose. The genus Guibourtia (Fabaceae, Detarioideae), characterized by two South American and 13 African tree species growing in various tropical biomes, is an interesting model to address the role of biogeographic processes and adaptation to contrasted environments on species diversification. Combining whole plastid genome sequencing and morphological characters analysis, we studied the timing of speciation and diversification processes in Guibourtia through molecular dating and ancestral habitats reconstruction. All species except G. demeusei and G. copallifera appear monophyletic. Dispersal from Africa to America across the Atlantic Ocean is the most plausible hypothesis to explain the occurrence of Neotropical Guibourtia species, which diverged ca. 11.8 Ma from their closest African relatives. The diversification of the three main clades of African Guibourtia is concomitant to Miocene global climate changes, highlighting pre-Quaternary speciation events. These clades differ by their reproductive characters, which validates the three subgenera previously described: Pseudocopaiva, Guibourtia and Gorskia. Within most monophyletic species, plastid lineages start diverging from each other during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene, suggesting that these species already arose during this period. The multiple transitions between rain forests and dry forests/savannahs inferred here through the plastid phylogeny in each Guibourtia subgenus address thus new questions about the role of phylogenetic relationships in shaping ecological niche and morphological similarity among taxa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Some clover species, particularly Trifolium subterraneum, have previously been reported to have highly unusual plastomes, relative to closely related legumes, enlarged with many duplications, gene losses and the presence of DNA unique to Trifolium, which may represent horizontal transfer. In order to pinpoint the evolutionary origin of this phenomenon within the genus Trifolium, we sequenced and assembled the plastomes of eight additional Trifolium species widely sampled from across the genus. RESULTS The Trifolium plastomes fell into two groups: those of Trifolium boissieri, T. strictum and T. glanduliferum (representing subgenus Chronosemium and subg. Trifolium section Paramesus) were tractable, assembled readily and were not unusual in the general context of Fabeae plastomes. The other Trifolium species ("core Trifolium") proved refractory to assembly mainly because of numerous short duplications. These species form a single clade, which we call the "refractory clade" (comprising subg, Trifolium sections Lupinaster, Trifolium, Trichocephalum, Vesicastrum and Trifoliastrum). The characteristics of the refractory clade are the presence of numerous short duplications and 7-15\% longer genomes than the tractable species. Molecular dating estimates that the origin of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the refractory clade is approximately 13.1 million years ago (MYA). This is considerably younger than the estimated MRCA ages of Trifolium (c. 18.6 MYA) and Trifolium subg. Trifolium (16.1 MYA). CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the unusual repetitive plastome type previously characterized in Trifolium subterraneum had a single origin within Trifolium and is characteristic of most (but not all) species of subgenus Trifolium. It appears that an ancestral plastome within Trifolium underwent an evolutionary change resulting in plastomes that either actively promoted, were permissive to, or were unable to control, duplications within the genome. The precise mechanism of this important change in the mode and tempo of plastome evolution deserves further investigation.},

	abstract = {Amorpha L. (false indigos and lead plants) is a North American legume genus of 16 species of shrubs, which is most diverse in the southeastern United States and distinctive due to the reduction of the corolla to a single petal. Most species have limited distributions, but the tetraploid A. fruticosa species complex is widely distributed and its range overlaps those of all of the other species. Morphological variation in the genus is characterized by gradation of characters among species and it has been the subject of repeated taxonomic study due to the difficulty in delimiting species, especially among A. fruticosa and allies. This study presents the first phylogenetic and network analyses for evaluation of relationships amongst Amorpha species based on three non-coding plastome regions (trnD-trnT, trnH-psbA, petN-psbM) and two low-copy nuclear genes (CNGC5, minD). Plastid DNA analyses supported a monophyletic Amorpha with Parryella filifolia and Errazurizia rotundata as successive sister lineages; however, nuclear gene analyses supported the nesting of these two species and thus a paraphyletic Amorpha. Relationships among species of Amorpha were best resolved in the plastid DNA phylogeny and in most cases were concordant with expectations based on morphology. Relationships based on the nuclear gene phylogenies were less clear due to lack of informative variation (CNGC5) or conflict in the data set (minD). The origins of A. fruticosa were unclear, but the plastid phylogeny revealed that this species shares the same or similar plastid haplotype as other species in a geographic region. Putative recombination of diploid species' alleles was evident in the minD-like network. Phenotypic plasticity in combination with gene flow into this species from different diploids, or even tetraploids, across its range may account for the incredible morphological diversity of the A. fruticosa species complex. Putative progenitors for two other suspected allotetraploid species, A. confusa and A. crenulata, were identified as A. fruticosa and A. herbacea.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY The genus Medicago, with about 87 species, includes the model legume species M. truncatula, and a number of important forage species such as M. sativa (alfalfa), M. scutellata (snail medic), and M. lupulina (black medic). Relationships within the genus are not yet sufficiently resolved, contributing to difficulty in understanding the evolution of a number of distinguishing characteristics such as aneuploidy and polyploidy, life history, structure of cotyledons, and number of seeds per fruit. • METHODS Phylogenetic relationships of 70-73 species of Medicago and its sister genus Trigonella (including Melilotus) were reconstructed from nucleotide sequences of the plastid trnK/matK region and the nuclear-encoded GA3ox1 gene (gibberellin 3-β-hydroxylase) using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. • KEY RESULTS Our results support certain currently recognized taxonomic groups, e.g., sect. Medicago (with M. sativa) and sect. Buceras. However, other strongly supported clades-the "reduced subsection Leptospireae clade" that includes M. lupulina, the "polymorpha clade" that includes M. murex and M. polymorpha and the "subsection Pachyspireae clade" that includes M. truncatula-each of which includes species presently in different subsections of sect. Spirocarpos, contradict the current classification. • CONCLUSIONS These results support the hypothesis that some characters considered important in existing taxonomies, for example, single-seeded fruits that have arisen more than once in both Medicago and Trigonella, are indeed homoplastic. Others, such as the 2n = 14 chromosome number, have also arisen independently within the genus. In addition, we demonstrate support for the utility of GA3ox1 sequences for phylogenetic analysis among and within closely related genera of legumes.},

Hymenaea courbaril is the most widespread species of the genus, ranging from southern Mexico to southeastern Brazil. As currently circumscribed, Hymenaea courbaril is a polytypic species with six varieties: var. altissima, var. courbaril, var. longifolia, var. stilbocarpa, var. subsessilis, and var. villosa. These varieties are distinguishable mostly by traits related to leaflet shape and indumentation, and calyx indumentation. We carried out morphometric analyses of 14 quantitative (continuous) leaf characters in order to assess the taxonomy of Hymenaea courbaril under the Unified Species Concept framework. Cluster analysis used the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) were carried out based on the same morphometric matrix. Two sets of Analyses of Similarity and Non Parametric Multivariate Analysis of Variance were carried out to evaluate statistical support (1) for the major groups recovered using UPGMA and PCA, and (2) for the varieties. All analyses recovered three major groups coincident with (1) var. altissima, (2) var. longifolia, and (3) all other varieties. These results, together with geographical and habitat information, were taken as evidence of three separate metapopulation lineages recognized here as three distinct species. Nomenclatural adjustments, including reclassifying formerly misapplied types, are proposed.},

	abstract = {Canavalia is a pantropical legume genus of lianas comprising approximately 60 species distributed in a wide range of habitats. In the last taxonomic revision, the genus was divided into four subgenera: Canavalia (Pantropical), Catodonia (Neotropical, excepting one species also found in the Old World), Maunaloa (Hawaiian), and Wenderothia (Neotropical). In this study, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Canavalia using a broad taxon sampling and analyses of nuclear (ETS and ITS) and plastid markers (trnK/matK). We evaluated the infrageneric classification of the genus and investigated its biogeographical history using molecular dating analyses and ancestral area reconstructions. The phylogenetic analyses resolved subgenus Wenderothia as monophyletic. Subgenus Catodonia needs to be recircumscribed and the relationships between subgenera Canavalia and Maunaloa remain unclear. Canavalia arose during the Miocene with a mean stem age estimate of 13.8Ma and mean crown age estimate of 8.7Ma, and most extant species evolved during the Pleistocene. Several climatic and geological events are chronologically coincident with the divergence of the major clades of Canavalia (glacial/interglacial periods, Andes uplift and the formation of Pebas and post-Pebas systems, closure of the Isthmus of Panama, and change in the direction of ocean currents). Ancestral area reconstructions for the early divergence of the genus are equivocal, although, some evidence suggests Canavalia originated in the wet forests of South America and achieved its current pantropical distribution through recent transoceanic dispersal. The evolution of Canavalia is better explained by a series of several processes than by discrete historical events.},

They are well known as important sources of rotenone toxin, which are used as organic insecticide and fish poison. However, their phylogenetic relationships and classification are still problematic due to insufficient sampling and high morphological variability. METHODS Fifty species of palaeotropic Derris-like taxa were sampled, which is more than in former studies. Three chloroplast genes (trnK-matK, trnL-F IGS, and psbA-trnH IGS) and nuclear ribosomal ITS /5.8S were analyzed using parsimony and Bayesian methods. KEY RESULTS Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of individual and combined markers show more or less similar tree topologies (only varying in terminal branches). The old-world monophyletic genera Aganope, Brachypterum, and Leptoderris are distinct from Derris s.s., and their generic status is here confirmed. Aganope may be classified into two or three subgeneric taxa. Paraderris has to be included in Derris s.s. to form a monophyletic group. The genera Philenoptera, Deguelia, and Lonchocarpus are monophyletic and distinct from each other and clearly separate from Derris s.s. Morphologically highly similar species of Derris s.s. are shown to be unrelated. Our study shows that previous infrageneric classifications of Derris are incorrect. Paraderris elliptica may contain several cryptic lineages that need further investigation. CONCLUSIONS The concept of the genus Derris s.s. should be reorganized with a new generic circumscription by including Paraderris but excluding Brachypterum. Synapomorphic morphological features will be examined in future studies, and the status of the newly defined Derris and its closely related taxa will be formalized.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Large genera provide remarkable opportunities to investigate patterns of morphological evolution and historical biogeography in plants. A molecular phylogeny of the species-rich and morphologically and ecologically diverse genus Mimosa was generated to evaluate its infrageneric classification, reconstruct the evolution of a set of morphological characters, and establish the relationships of Old World species to the rest of the genus. METHODS We used trnD-trnT plastid sequences for 259 species of Mimosa (ca. 50\% of the total) to reconstruct the phylogeny of the genus. Six morphological characters (petiolar nectary, inflorescence type, number of stamens, number of petals, pollen type, and seismonasty) were optimized onto the molecular tree. KEY RESULTS Mimosa was recovered as a monophyletic clade nested within the Piptadenia group and includes the former members of Schrankia, corroborating transfer of that genus to Mimosa. Although we found good support for several infrageneric groups, only one section (Mimadenia) was recovered as monophyletic. All but one of the morphological characters analyzed showed high levels of homoplasy. High levels of geographic structure were found, with species from the same area tending to group together in the phylogeny. Old World species of Mimosa form a monophyletic clade deeply nested within New World groups, indicating recent (6-10 Ma) long-distance dispersal. CONCLUSIONS Although based on a single plastid region, our results establish a preliminary phylogenetic framework for Mimosa that can be used to infer patterns of morphological evolution and relationships and which provides pointers toward a revised infrageneric classification.},

A comprehensive range of such diversity is evaluated within tribe Indigofereae and outgroups from sister tribes. A combined data set of 321 taxa (over one-third of the tribe) by 80 morphological characters, 833 aligned nuclear ribosomal ITS/5.8S sites, and an indel data set of 33 characters was subjected to parsimony analysis. Notable results include the Madagascan dry forest Disynstemon resolved as sister to tribe Indigofereae, and all species of the large genus Indigofera comprise just four main clades, each diagnosable by morphological synapomorphies and ecological and geographical predilections. These results suggest niche conservation (ecology) and dispersal limitation (geography) are important processes rendering signature shapes to the Indigofereae phylogeny in different biomes. Clades confined to temperate and succulent-rich biomes are more dispersal limited and have more geographical phylogenetic structure than those inhabiting tropical grass-rich vegetation. The African arid corridor, particularly the Namib center of endemism, harbors many of the oldest Indigofera lineages. A rates analysis of nucleotide substitutions confirms that the ages of the oldest crown clades are mostly younger than 16 Ma, implicating dispersal in explaining the worldwide distribution of the tribe.},

Analyses of ITS data and of a combined data set that included sequences of ITS and two chloroplast genes supported several conclusions that were interpreted in light of fossil data and current legume phylogeny. Gleditsia and Gymnocladus appear to have originated in eastern Asia during the Eocene. Eastern North American species of both genera most likely evolved from ancestors that migrated across the Bering land bridge, but the eastern Asian/eastern North American disjunction appears to be much older in Gymnocladus than in Gleditsia. Gleditsia amorphoides, from temperate South America, is sister to the rest of the genus, suggesting early long-distance dispersal from Asia. The remainder of Gleditsia is divided into three unresolved clades, possibly indicating a split early in the evolution of the genus. Two of those clades contain only Asian species, and one contains Asian and North American species. The North American species, Gleditsia triacanthos and Gleditsia aquatica, are polymorphic and paraphyletic with respect to their ITS and cpDNA sequences, which suggests recent diversification.},

The Brownea clade (Leguminosae) is a characteristic component of the Neotropical flora, and the species within it are diverse in their floral morphology, attracting a wide variety of pollinators. This investigation aimed to estimate species divergence times and infer relationships within the group, in order to test whether the Brownea clade followed the 'cradle' or 'museum' model of diversification, i.e. whether species evolved rapidly over a short time period, or gradually over many millions of years. We also aimed to trace the spatio-temporal evolution of the clade by estimating ancestral biogeographical patterns in the group. We used BEAST to build a dated phylogeny of 73 Brownea clade species using three molecular markers (ITS, trnK and psbA-trnH), resulting in well-resolved phylogenetic relationships within the clade, as well as robust divergence time estimates from which we inferred diversification rates and ancestral biogeography. Our analyses revealed an Eocene origin for the group, after which the majority of diversification happened in Amazonia during the Miocene, most likely concurrent with climatic and geological changes caused by the rise of the Andes. We found no shifts in diversification rate over time, suggesting a gradual accumulation of lineages with low extinction rates. These results may help to understand why Amazonia is host to the highest diversity of tree species on Earth.},

Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were done using nuclear rDNA ITS and chloroplast spacers trnD-trnT and trnfM-trnS1, either separately or in combination. The effect of using partitioned vs. nonpartitioned analyses in a Bayesian approach was evaluated. Highest resolution was obtained when the data were combined in partitioned or nonpartitioned Bayesian analyses. All phylogenies support two clades of South American species nested within the North American species, implying two separate invasions from North to South America. These two clades correspond to the original morphological classification of Johnston (1947 Journal of the Arnold Arboretum 28: 336-409). The mean ages of the South American clades were very recent but still significantly different (1.89 and 0.98 Ma). Upper and lower bounds on rates of diversification varied between 2.01 and 0.65 species/Ma for the older clade and 2.06 and 1.24 species/Ma for the younger clade. Even the lower bounds are still very high, reasserting Neo-Astragalus in the growing list of recent rapid radiations of plants, especially in areas with a high physiographic diversity, such as the Andes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Tribe Fabeae comprises about 380 legume species, including some of the most ancient and important crops like lentil, pea, and broad bean. Breeding efforts in legume crops rely on a detailed knowledge of closest wild relatives and geographic origin. Relationships within the tribe, however, are incompletely known and previous molecular results conflicted with the traditional morphology-based classification. Here we analyse the systematics, biogeography, and character evolution in the tribe based on plastid and nuclear DNA sequences. RESULTS Phylogenetic analyses including c. 70\% of the species in the tribe show that the genera Vicia and Lathyrus in their current circumscription are not monophyletic: Pisum and Vavilovia are nested in Lathyrus, the genus Lens is nested in Vicia. A small, well-supported clade including Vicia hirsuta, V. sylvatica, and some Mediterranean endemics, is the sister group to all remaining species in the tribe. Fabeae originated in the East Mediterranean region in the Miocene (23-16 million years ago (Ma)) and spread at least 39 times into Eurasia, seven times to the Americas, twice to tropical Africa and four times to Macaronesia. Broad bean (V. faba) and its sister V. paucijuga originated in Asia and might be sister to V. oroboides. Lentil (Lens culinaris ssp. culinaris) is of Mediterranean origin and together with eight very close relatives forms a clade that is nested in the core Vicia, where it evolved c. 14 Ma. The Pisum clade is nested in Lathyrus in a grade with the Mediterranean L. gloeosperma, L. neurolobus, and L. nissolia. The extinct Azorean endemic V. dennesiana belongs in section Cracca and is nested among Mediterranean species. According to our ancestral character state reconstruction results, ancestors of Fabeae had a basic chromosome number of 2n=14, an annual life form, and evenly hairy, dorsiventrally compressed styles. CONCLUSIONS Fabeae evolved in the Eastern Mediterranean in the middle Miocene and spread from there across Eurasia, into Tropical Africa, and at least seven times to the Americas. The middle-Atlantic islands were colonized four times but apparently did not serve as stepping-stones for Atlantic crossings. Long-distance dispersal events are relatively common in Fabeae (seven per ten million years). Current generic and infrageneric circumscriptions in Fabeae do not reflect monophyletic groups and should be revised. Suggestions for generic level delimitation are offered.},

Divergence times are estimated using a Bayesian method assuming a relaxed molecular clock (multidivtime). Within the Pterocarpus clade, new sister relationships are recovered: Pterocarpus + Etaballia, Inocarpus + Tipuana and Paramachaerium + Maraniona. Our results support monophyly of Platymiscium, which is resolved into three major clades, each with distinct geographic ranges and ecological preferences. Diversification in Platymiscium has been driven by habitat fragmentation, invasion of novel geographic regions, and ecological diversification, revealing general patterns of diversification in the neotropics. We hypothesize that Platymiscium arose in dry habitats of South America and radiated northward. The Amazon basin was invaded twice both within the last 5.6 My and Central America twice before the closure of the Isthmus of Panama. Divergence times of the P. pubescens complex, restricted to seasonally dry tropical forests of South America, support pre-Pleistocene divergence in this biome.},

We sampled 48\% of the species from all sections (and representatives of the 15 remaining Crotalarieae genera) for nuclear and plastid DNA markers to infer changes in climate niches, flower morphology, leaf type, and chromosome numbers. RESULTS Crotalaria is monophyletic and most closely related to African Bolusia (five species) from which it diverged 23 to 30 Ma ago. Ancestral state reconstructions reveal that leaf and flower types are conserved in large clades and that leaf type is uncorrelated to climate as assessed with phylogenetically-informed analyses that related compound vs. simple leaves to the mean values of four Bioclim parameters for 183 species with good occurrence data. Most species occur in open habitats {\textless}1000 m alt., and trifoliolate leaves are the ancestral condition, from which unifoliolate and simple leaves each evolved a few times, the former predominantly in humid, the latter mainly in dry climates. Based on chromosome counts for 36\% of the 338 sequenced species, most polyploids are tetraploid and belong to a neotropical clade. CONCLUSIONS An unexpected finding of our study is that in Crotalaria, simple leaves predominate in humid climates and compound leaves in dry climates, which points to a different adaptive value of these morphologies, regardless of whether these two leaf types evolved rarely or frequently in our focal group.},

The genus comprises 20 species predominantly distributed in Amazonia and has been traditionally classified in the tribe Swartzieae because of its radial flowers with an entire calyx and numerous free stamens. The taxonomy of Aldina is complicated due to its poor representation in herbaria and the lack of a robust phylogenetic hypothesis of relationship. Recent phylogenetic analyses of matK and trnL sequences confirmed the placement of Aldina in the 50-kb inversion clade, although the genus remained phylogenetically isolated or unresolved in the context of the evolutionary history of the main early-branching papilionoid lineages. We performed maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of combined chloroplast datasets (matK, rbcL, and trnL) and explored the effect of incomplete taxa or missing data in order to shed light on the enigmatic phylogenetic position of Aldina. Unexpectedly, a sister relationship of Aldina with the Andira clade (Andira and Hymenolobium) is revealed. We suggest that a new tribal phylogenetic classification of the papilionoid legumes should place Aldina along with Andira and Hymenolobium. These results highlight yet another example of the independent evolution of radial floral symmetry within the early-branching Papilionoideae, a large collection of florally heterogeneous lineages dominated by papilionate or bilaterally symmetric flower morphology.},

Currently, they are considered as a separate section within genus Lotus, distinct from other herbaceous Canarian congeners which are yellow-flowered and bee-pollinated. A combined analysis of four nuclear regions (including ITS and three homologues of CYCLOIDEA) and three plastid regions (CYB6, matK and trnH-psbA) nests the four bird-pollinated species within a single extant species of bee-pollinated Lotus (L. sessilifolius), in a very extreme example of species paraphyly. Therefore, our data compellingly support the hypothesis that the Macaronesian Lotus species with a bird pollination syndrome are recently derived from entomophilous ancestors. Calibration of the phylogenetic trees using geological age estimates of the most recent islands (La Palma and El Hierro) together with oldest ages of Fuerteventura indicates that bird pollination evolved ca. 1.7 Ma in the Canarian Lotus. These four bird-pollinated species share a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with L. sessilifolius that dates to about 2.2 Ma. Our analyses further suggest that the evolution of the bird pollination syndrome was likely triggered by the availability of new niches in La Palma and Tenerife as a result of recent volcanic activity.},

This genus contains 20 species distributed throughout Europe, Africa, and the Mediterranean basin. The most widespread species is A. vulneraria, and over 30 intraspecies taxa have been identified based on plant morphology. To study the molecular phylogeny of the genus, the sequences of the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 of the nuclear ribosomal DNA of 10 Anthyllis species, including 11 subspecies of A. vulneraria and three subspecies of A. montana, were obtained and analysed together with sequences of five other species of the genus obtained from GenBank. Our results suggest that the genus Anthyllis is not monophyletic and is divided in two main clades: the Anthyllis sensu strictu and the "tetraphylla clade". The former includes most of the Anthyllis species, and the latter includes three annual species more closely related to Lotus. All the taxa were also analysed according to seven chloroplast microsatellites, and these data closely confirm the results obtained with the ITS phylogeny.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12862-014-0181-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND Given that most species that have ever existed on earth are extinct, it stands to reason that the evolutionary history can be better understood with fossil taxa. Bauhinia is a typical genus of pantropical intercontinental disjunction among the Asian, African, and American continents. Geographic distribution patterns are better recognized when fossil records and molecular sequences are combined in the analyses. Here, we describe a new macrofossil species of Bauhinia from the Upper Miocene Xiaolongtan Formation in Wenshan County, Southeast Yunnan, China, and elucidate the biogeographic significance through the analyses of molecules and fossils. RESULTS Morphometric analysis demonstrates that the leaf shapes of B. acuminata, B. championii, B. chalcophylla, B. purpurea, and B. podopetala closely resemble the leaf shapes of the new finding fossil. Phylogenetic relationships among the Bauhinia species were reconstructed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference, which inferred that species in Bauhinia species are well-resolved into three main groups. Divergence times were estimated by the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method under a relaxed clock, and inferred that the stem diversification time of Bauhinia was ca. 62.7 Ma. The Asian lineage first diverged at ca. 59.8 Ma, followed by divergence of the Africa lineage starting during the late Eocene, whereas that of the neotropical lineage starting during the middle Miocene. CONCLUSIONS Hypotheses relying on vicariance or continental history to explain pantropical disjunct distributions are dismissed because they require mostly Palaeogene and older tectonic events. We suggest that Bauhinia originated in the middle Paleocene in Laurasia, probably in Asia, implying a possible Tethys Seaway origin or an "Out of Tropical Asia", and dispersal of legumes. Its present pantropical disjunction resulted from disruption of the boreotropical flora by climatic cooling after the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). North Atlantic land bridges (NALB) seem the most plausible route for migration of Bauhinia from Asia to America; and additional aspects of the Bauhinia species distribution are explained by migration and long distance dispersal (LDD) from Eurasia to the African and American continents.},

In this study, we inferred a phylogeny for Amorpheae using DNA sequence data from the plastid trnK intron, including matK, and the nuclear ribosomal ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2. Our data resulted in a well-resolved phylogeny in which the tribe is divided into the daleoids (Dalea, Marina, and Psorothamnus), characterized by generally papilionaceous corollas, and the amorphoids (Amorpha, Apoplanesia, Errazurizia, Eysenhardtia, and Parryella), characterized by non-papilionaceous flowers. We found evidence for the paraphyly of Psorothamnus and for the monophyly of Dalea once D. filiciformis is transferred to monophyletic Marina. Errazurizia rotundata is more closely related to Amorpha than to the other errazurizias, and Eysenhardtia is supported to be monophyletic. The monotypic Parryella and Apoplanesia are placed within the amorphoids. Among Papilionoideae, trnK/matK sequence data provide strong evidence for the monophyly of Amorpheae and place Amorpheae as sister to the recently discovered dalbergioid clade.},

The results of several analyses revealed that extensive robustly supported incongruence exists among the nuclear genes, the cause of which we seek to explain. After rejecting several processes, hybridization and lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms remained as the most likely factors promoting incongruence. Using coalescence simulations, we rejected lineage sorting alone as an explanation of the differences among gene trees. The results indicate that hybridization has been common and ongoing among lineages since the origin of Medicago. Coalescence provides a good framework to test the causes of incongruence commonly seen among gene trees but requires knowledge of effective population sizes and generation times. We estimated the effective population size at 240,000 individuals and assumed a generation time of 1 year in Medicago (many are annual plants). A sensitivity analysis showed that our conclusions remain unchanged using a larger effective population size and/or longer generation time.},

Our results support the monophyly of only one (Psilorhegma) of the six currently recognized sections, while Chamaefistula, Peiranisia, and Senna are paraphyletic, and monotypic Astroites and Paradictyon are nested within two of the seven major clades identified by our molecular phylogeny. Two clades (I, VII) include only species with monosymmetric flowers, while the remaining clades (II-VI) contain species with asymmetric, enantiostylous flowers, in which either the gynoecium alone or, in addition, corolla and androecium variously contribute to the asymmetry. Our results further suggest that flowers were ancestrally monosymmetric with seven fertile stamens and three adaxial staminodes, switched to asymmetry later, and reverted to monosymmetry in clade VII. Fertility of all 10 stamens is a derived state, characterizing the Psilorhegma subclade. Extrafloral nectaries evolved once and constitute a synapomorphy for clades IV-VII ("EFN clade"). These nectaries may represent a key innovation in plant defense strategies that enabled Senna to undergo large-scale diversification.},

	abstract = {The Caesalpinieae grade (Leguminosae) forms a morphologically and ecologically diverse group of mostly tropical tree species with a complex evolutionary history. This grade comprises several distinct lineages, but the exact delimitation of the group relative to subfamily Mimosoideae and other members of subfamily Caesalpinioideae, as well as phylogenetic relationships among the lineages are uncertain. With the aim of better resolving phylogenetic relationships within the Caesalpinieae grade, we investigated the utility of several nuclear markers developed from genomic studies in the Papilionoideae. We cloned and sequenced the low copy nuclear gene sucrose synthase (SUSY) and combined the data with plastid trnL and matK sequences. SUSY has two paralogs in the Caesalpinieae grade and in the Mimosoideae, but occurs as a single copy in all other legumes tested. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses suggest the two nuclear markers are congruent with plastid DNA data. The Caesalpinieae grade is divided into four well-supported clades (Cassia, Caesalpinia, Tachigali and Peltophorum clades), a poorly supported clade of Dimorphandra Group genera, and two paraphyletic groups, one with other Dimorphandra Group genera and the other comprising genera previously recognized as the Umtiza clade. A selection analysis of the paralogs, using selection models from PAML, suggests that SUSY genes are subjected to a purifying selection. One of the SUSY paralogs, under slightly stronger positive selection, may be undergoing subfunctionalization. The low copy SUSY gene is useful for phylogeny reconstruction in the Caesalpinieae despite the presence of duplicate copies. This study confirms that the Caesalpinieae grade is an artificial group, and highlights the need for further analyses of lineages at the base of the Mimosoideae.},

	abstract = {SymRK is one of the key genes involved in initial steps of legume symbiotic association with fungi (mycorrhization) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (nodulation). A large portion of the sequence encoding the extracellular domain of SYMRK was obtained for 38 lupine accessions and 2 outgroups in order to characterize this region, to evaluate its phylogenetic utility, and to examine whether its molecular evolutionary pattern is correlated with rhizobial diversity and specificity in Lupinus. The data suggested that, in Lupinus, SymRK is a single copy gene that shows good phylogenetic potential. Accordingly, SymRK provided additional support to previous molecular phylogenies, and shed additional light on relationships within the Old World group of Lupinus, especially among the African species. Similar to results of other studies, analyses of SymRK sequences were unable to resolve placement of the Florida unifoliolate lineage, whose relationship was weakly supported to either the Old or the New World lupines. Our data are consistent with strong purifying selection operating on SymRK in Lupinus, preserving rather than diversifying its function. Thus, although SymRK was demonstrated to be a vital gene in the early stages of the root-bacterial symbiotic associations, no evidence from present analyses indicate that this gene is involved in changes in rhizobial specificity in Lupinus.},

Sequence data were used to reconstruct the underlying molecular phylogeny. Several clusters and furcations were identical in the rbcL and ITS trees of the Papilionoideae, indicating that a reticulate evolution due to past hybridization of members from different tribes and genera is unlikely: The Sophoreae (especially Styphnolobium japonicum (syn. Sophora japonica) and Sophora secundiflora) are positioned at the base of the papilionoid tree, whereas some other Sophora species (Sophora davidii, flavescens, jaubertii, microphylla) are closely related to Thermopsideae/Podalyrieae. The Thermopsideae/Podylyrieae cluster (including Liparieae) shares ancestry with the Crotalarieae and Genisteae. Argyrolobium (African taxa) and Melolobium cluster between Crotalarieae and Genisteae. In the Genisteae three clusters are apparent: the monophyletic genus Lupinus, the Cytisus-, and the Genista-group. According to this analysis, the Cytisus-complex includes Cytisus, Lembotropis, Chamaecytisus, Spartocytisus, and Calicotome. The Genista-group consists of Genista, Teline, and Chamaespartium sagittale. Other genera (e.g., Adenocarpus, Argyrocytisus, Cytisophyllum, Erinacea, Laburnum, Petteria, Retama, Spartium, and Ulex) could not be attributed unequivocally to the Cytisus or Genista complex.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The subgenus Ceratotropis in the genus Vigna is widely distributed from the Himalayan highlands to South, Southeast and East Asia. However, the interspecific and geographical relationships of its members are poorly understood. This study investigates the phylogeny and biogeography of the subgenus Ceratotropis using chloroplast DNA sequence data. METHODS Sequence data from four intergenic spacer regions (petA-psbJ, psbD-trnT, trnT-trnE and trnT-trnL) of chloroplast DNA, alone and in combination, were analysed using Bayesian and parsimony methods. Divergence times for major clades were estimated with penalized likelihood. Character evolution was examined by means of parsimony optimization and MacClade. KEY RESULTS Parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses on the combined data demonstrated well-resolved species relationships in which 18 Vigna species were divided into two major geographical clades: the East Asia-Southeast Asian clade and the Indian subcontinent clade. Within these two clades, three well-supported eco-geographical groups, temperate and subtropical (the East Asia-Southeast Asian clade) and tropical (the Indian subcontinent clade), are recognized. The temperate group consists of V. minima, V. nepalensis and V. angularis. The subtropical group comprises the V. nakashimae-V. riukiuensis-V. minima subgroup and the V. hirtella-V. exilis-V. umbellata subgroup. The tropical group contains two subgroups: the V. trinervia-V. reflexo-pilosa-V. trilobata subgroup and the V. mungo-V. grandiflora subgroup. An evolutionary rate analysis estimated the divergence time between the East Asia-Southeast Asia clade and the Indian subcontinent clade as 3·62 ± 0·3 million years, and that between the temperate and subtropical groups as 2·0 ± 0·2 million years. CONCLUSIONS The findings provide an improved understanding of the interspecific relationships, and ecological and geographical phylogenetic structure of the subgenus Ceratotropis. The quaternary diversification of the subgenus Ceratotropis implicates its geographical dispersal in the south-eastern part of Asia involving adaptation to climatic condition after the collision of the Indian subcontinent with the Asian plate. The phylogenetic results indicate that the epigeal germination is plesiomorphic, and the germination type evolved independently multiple times in this subgenus, implying its limited taxonomic utility.},

METHODS Isozymes encoded by 15 putative loci of ten enzymes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isozyme variation was analysed by using parsimony and neighbour-joining methods. KEY RESULTS The analyses revealed 63 parsimony-informative and 36 species-specific orthozymes. Of the latter, 23 are monomophic and are suitable for identification of V. benghalensis, V. palaestina, V. dumetorum, V. pisiformis, V. sylvatica, V. onobrychioides, V. cappadocica, V. cretica, V. articulata, V. tetrasperma, V. ervilia, V. hirsuta and V. loiseleurii. Polymorphism with heterozygous and homozygous isozyme genotypes was found for V. cracca, V. tenuifolia, V. ochroleuca, V. villosa, V. sylvatica, V. cassubica, V. sparsiflora, V. megalotropis, V. altissima, V. onobrychioides, V. cassia, V. cretica and L. heterophyllus, reflecting outcrossing in these species. By contrast, V. benghalensis, V. palaestina, V. disperma, V. dumetorum, V. pisiformis, V. orobus, V. pauciflora, V. tetrasperma and V. loiseleurii had only homozygous isozyme genotypes at polymorphic loci. Isozyme-based phylogenetic trees are presented. CONCLUSIONS Sections Cracca, Ervum, Pedunculatae and Lenticula of traditional taxonomy are monophyletic groups, whereas sections Oroboideae (= Vicilla) and Panduratae appear polyphyletic and section Cassubicae is split into two species-couples linked at a low level of support. Treatment of ervoid species in a separate subgenus Ervum is not supported because of its polyphyly.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Leucaena comprises 17 diploid species, five tetraploid species, and a complex series of hybrids whose evolutionary histories have been influenced by human seed translocation, cultivation, and subsequent spontaneous hybridization. Here we investigated patterns of evolutionary divergence among diploid Leucaena through comprehensively sampled multilocus phylogenetic and population genetic approaches to address species delimitation, interspecific relationships, hybridization, and the predominant mode of speciation among diploids. METHODS Parsimony- and maximum-likelihood-based phylogenetic approaches were applied to 59 accessions sequenced for six SCAR-based nuclear loci, nrDNA ITS, and four cpDNA regions. Population genetic comparisons included 1215 AFLP loci representing 42 populations and 424 individuals. RESULTS Phylogenetic results provided a well-resolved hypothesis of divergent species relationships, recovering previously recognized clades of diploids as well as newly resolved relationships. Phylogenetic and population genetic assessments identified two cryptic species that are consistent with geography and morphology. CONCLUSIONS Findings from this study highlight the importance and utility of multilocus data in the recovery of complex evolutionary histories. The results are consistent with allopatric divergence representing the predominant mode of speciation among diploid Leucaena. These findings contrast with the potential hybrid origin of several tetraploid species and highlight the importance of human translocation of seed to the origin of these tetraploids. The recognition of one previously unrecognized species (L. cruziana) and the elevation of another taxon (L. collinsii subsp. zacapana) to specific status (L. zacapana) is consistent with a growing number of newly diagnosed species from neotropical seasonally dry forests, suggesting these communities harbor greater species diversity than previously recognized.},

	abstract = {The disjunct genus Cercis has been used to test models of Northern Hemisphere historical biogeography. Previous phylogenetic estimates employing DNA sequences of the ITS region and (in one study) those of ndhF recovered a well supported clade of North American and western Eurasian species that was nested within a paraphyletic group of Chinese species. Resolution and clade support within the tree were otherwise low and the monophyly of Cercis canadensis was uncertain. Here we conduct a phylogenetic analysis of Cercis with a higher number of regions (ITS, ndhF, rpoB-trnC, trnT-trnD, and trnS-trnG) and samples than in previous studies. Results corroborate the initial divergence between the Chinese species Cercis chingii and the rest of the genus. Support is newly found both for a clade of the two North American species as sister to the western Eurasian species, and for the monophyly of C. canadensis. As in a previous study, divergence between North American and western Eurasian Cercis was estimated as mid-Miocene (ca. 13 million years ago), and the ancestor in which this divergence occurred was inferred to be xerophytic. Contrary to previous studies, however, our data infer strictly east-to-west vicariance. The timing of the transatlantic divergence in Cercis is too recent to be explained by a postulated continuous belt of semi-arid vegetation between North America and Europe in the Paleogene, suggesting instead the presence of a Miocene North Atlantic corridor for semi-arid plants. In the absence of strong evidence from other sources, the possibility that Cercis has been able to quickly adapt from mesophytic antecedents to semi-arid conditions whenever the latter have arisen in the Northern Hemisphere can be considered a plausible alternative, although parsimony optimization renders this scenario two steps longer.},

In this study morphological characters in the caesalpinioid clade Detarieae are evaluated within a phylogenetic framework as a means of better understanding phylogenetic relationships and morphological evolution. METHODS Morphological characters were observed and scored for representative species of Detarieae focusing on the resin-producing genera. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out with morphological characters alone and then combined with DNA sequences. KEY RESULTS Despite a high level of homoplasy, morphological data support several clades corresponding to those recovered in molecular phylogenetic analyses. The more strongly supported clades are each defined by at least one morphological synapomorphy. Several characters (e.g. apetaly) previously used to define informal generic groups evolved several times independently, leading to the differences observed with the molecular phylogenetic analyses. Although floral evolution is complex in Detarieae some patterns are recovered. CONCLUSIONS New informal taxonomic groupings are proposed based on the present findings. Floral evolution in the diverse Detarieae clade is characterized by a repeated tendency toward zygomorphy through the reduction of lateral petals and toward complete loss of petals.},

We conducted parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer and chloroplast trnL intron sequences obtained from 218 of the ca. 255 species of Trifolium, representatives from 11 genera of the vicioid clade, and an outgroup Lotus. We confirm the monophyly of Trifolium, and propose a new infrageneric classification of the genus based on the phylogenetic results. Incongruence between the nrDNA and cpDNA results suggests five to six cases of apparent hybrid speciation, and identifies the putative progenitors of the allopolyploids T. dubium, a widespread weed, and T. repens, the most commonly cultivated clover species. Character state reconstructions confirm 2n=16 as the ancestral chromosome number in Trifolium, and infer a minimum of 19 instances of aneuploidy and 22 of polyploidy in the genus. The ancestral life history is hypothesized to be annual in subgenus Chronosemium and equivocal in subgenus Trifolium. Transitions between the annual and perennial habit are common. Our results are consistent with a Mediterranean origin of the genus, probably in the Early Miocene. A single origin of all North and South American species is hypothesized, while the species of sub-Saharan Africa may originate from three separate dispersal events.},

This work presents a comprehensive phylogenetic investigation of Pueraria within the context of tribe Phaseoleae (Leguminosae).

Two nuclear (ITS and Waxy) and six chloroplast (trnS/G, trnL/F, trnK, matK, trnD/T, and rpoB-trnC) DNA regions were sequenced from 43 species of North American Psoraleeae as the foundation of the study.

Phylogenetic signal within indels was higher in chloroplast regions relative to nuclear regions, demonstrating their inclusion as especially important in chloroplast-based phylogenetic studies. Phylogenetic analysis of generic relationships within Psoraleeae is largely congruent with that proposed by Grimes (1990) with a few exceptions. New World species are supported as a monophyletic group.

These studies reveal a more gradual emergence, with the oldest clades originating in the Eocene, but others appearing later, some as recently as the Pliocene. That there are factors which might affect the dates recovered, such as choice of calibration point, analysis method, sampling density and the delimitation of Cape floral clades, suggests a need for further critical evaluation of the age estimates presented to date. In this study, the dates of origin of two Cape floral clades (the legume Crotalarieae p.p. and Podalyrieae) are estimated, constrained by a shared calibration point in a single analysis using an rDNA ITS phylogeny in which 633 taxa are sampled. The results indicate that these two clades arose contemporaneously 44-46 mya, not at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary as had been previously supposed. The contemporaneous origin of these Cape floral clades suggests that additional more inclusive analyses are needed before rejecting the hypothesis that a single environmental trigger explains the establishment of Cape floral clades.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The evolutionary events that have shaped biodiversity patterns in the African rainforests are still poorly documented. Past forest fragmentation and ecological gradients have been advocated as important drivers of genetic differentiation but their respective roles remain unclear. Using nuclear microsatellites (nSSRs) and chloroplast non-coding sequences (pDNA), we characterised the spatial genetic structure of Erythrophleum (Fabaceae) forest trees in West and Central Africa (Guinea Region, GR). This widespread genus displays a wide ecological amplitude and taxonomists recognize two forest tree species, E. ivorense and E. suaveolens, which are difficult to distinguish in the field and often confused. RESULTS Bayesian-clustering applied on nSSRs of a blind sample of 648 specimens identified three major gene pools showing no or very limited introgression. They present parapatric distributions correlated to rainfall gradients and forest types. One gene pool is restricted to coastal evergreen forests and corresponds to E. ivorense; a second one is found in gallery forests from the dry forest zone of West Africa and North-West Cameroon and corresponds to West-African E. suaveolens; the third gene pool occurs in semi-evergreen forests and corresponds to Central African E. suaveolens. These gene pools have mostly unique pDNA haplotypes but they do not form reciprocally monophyletic clades. Nevertheless, pDNA molecular dating indicates that the divergence between E. ivorense and Central African E. suaveolens predates the Pleistocene. Further Bayesian-clustering applied within each major gene pool identified diffuse genetic discontinuities (minor gene pools displaying substantial introgression) at a latitude between 0 and 2°N in Central Africa for both species, and at a longitude between 5° and 8°E for E. ivorense. Moreover, we detected evidence of past population declines which are consistent with historical habitat fragmentation induced by Pleistocene climate changes. CONCLUSIONS Overall, deep genetic differentiation (major gene pools) follows ecological gradients that may be at the origin of speciation, while diffuse differentiation (minor gene pools) are tentatively interpreted as the signature of past forest fragmentation induced by past climate changes.},

The subtribe Chesneyinae is composed of four well-supported genera: Chesneya, Chesniella, Gueldenstaedtia and Tibetia. Based on phylogenetic, morphological, distributional and habitat type evidence, the genus Chesneya was divided into three monophyletic sections: Chesneya sect. Chesneya, Chesneya sect. Pulvinatae and Chesneya sect. Spinosae. Chesneya macrantha is herein transferred into Chesniella. Spongiocarpella is polyphyletic and its generic rank is not maintained. The position of Chesneya was incongruent in the nuclear ITS and the plastid trees. A paternal chloroplast capture event via introgression is hypothesized for the origin of Chesneya, which is postulated to have involved the common ancestor of Chesniella (♂) and that of the Gueldenstaedtia - Tibetia (GUT) clade (♀) as the parents.},

	abstract = {Replicate radiations provide powerful comparative systems to address questions about the interplay between opportunity and innovation in driving episodes of diversification and the factors limiting their subsequent progression. However, such systems have been rarely documented at intercontinental scales. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis of multiple radiations in the genus Lupinus (Leguminosae), which exhibits some of the highest known rates of net diversification in plants. Given that incomplete taxon sampling, background extinction, and lineage-specific variation in diversification rates can confound macroevolutionary inferences regarding the timing and mechanisms of cladogenesis, we used Bayesian relaxed clock phylogenetic analyses as well as MEDUSA and BiSSE birth-death likelihood models of diversification, to evaluate the evolutionary patterns of lineage accumulation in Lupinus. We identified 3 significant shifts to increased rates of net diversification (r) relative to background levels in the genus (r = 0.18-0.48 lineages/myr). The primary shift occurred approximately 4.6 Ma (r = 0.48-1.76) in the montane regions of western North America, followed by a secondary shift approximately 2.7 Ma (r = 0.89-3.33) associated with range expansion and diversification of allopatrically distributed sister clades in the Mexican highlands and Andes. We also recovered evidence for a third independent shift approximately 6.5 Ma at the base of a lower elevation eastern South American grassland and campo rupestre clade (r = 0.36-1.33). Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions and BiSSE likelihood analyses of correlated diversification indicated that increased rates of speciation are strongly associated with the derived evolution of perennial life history and invasion of montane ecosystems. Although we currently lack hard evidence for "replicate adaptive radiations" in the sense of convergent morphological and ecological trajectories among species in different clades, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that iteroparity functioned as an adaptive key innovation, providing a mechanism for range expansion and rapid divergence in upper elevation regions across much of the New World.},

For this study, three regions of rapidly evolving non-coding chloroplast DNA (trnL intron, trnS-trnG, and trnT-trnL) were examined to estimate the timing and rates of diversification in the western New World, and to infer ancestral states for geographic range, life history, and maximum elevation. The western New World species (5.0-9.3Mya, 0.6-1.1 spp./My) comprise a basally branching assemblage of annual plants endemic to the lower elevations of western North America, from which two species-rich clades are recently derived: (i) the western North American perennials from the Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, and Pacific Slope (0.7-2.1Mya, 2.0-5.9 spp./My) and (ii) the predominantly perennial species from the Andes Mountains of South America and highlands of Mexico (0.8-3.4Mya, 1.4-5.7spp./My). Bayesian posterior predictive tests for association between life history and maximum elevation demonstrate that perennials are positively correlated with higher elevations. These results are consistent with a series of one or more recent radiations in the western New World, and indicate that rapid diversification of Lupinus coincides with the derived evolution of perennial life history, colonization of montane habitats, and range expansion from North America to South America.},

	abstract = {Polyploidy has rarely been documented in rain forest trees but it has recently been found in African species of the genus Afzelia (Leguminosae), which is composed of four tetraploid rain forest species and two diploid dry forest species. The genus Afzelia thus provides an opportunity to examine how and when polyploidy and habitat shift occurred in Africa, and whether they are associated. In this study, we combined three plastid markers (psbA, trnL, ndhF), two nuclear markers (ribosomal ITS and the single-copy PEPC E7 gene), plastomes (obtained by High Throughput Sequencing) and morphological traits, with an extensive taxonomic and geographic sampling to explore the evolutionary history of Afzelia. Both nuclear DNA and morphological vegetative characters separated diploid from tetraploid lineages. Although the two African diploid species were well differentiated genetically and morphologically, the relationships among the tetraploid species were not resolved. In contrast to the nuclear markers, plastid markers revealed that one of the diploid species forms a well-supported clade with the tetraploids, suggesting historical hybridisation, possibly in relation with genome duplication (polyploidization) and habitat shift from dry to rain forests. Molecular dating based on fossil-anchored gene phylogenies indicates that extant Afzelia started diverging c. 14.5 or 20Ma while extant tetraploid species started diverging c. 7.0 or 9.4Ma according to plastid and nuclear DNA, respectively. Additional studies of tropical polyploid plants are needed to assess whether the ploidy-habitat association observed in African Afzelia would reflect a role of polyploidization in niche divergence in the tropics.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships in the genus Anthyllis (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae: Loteae) were investigated using data from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) and three plastid regions (psbA-trnH intergenic spacer, petB-petD region and rps16 intron). Bayesian and maximum parsimony (MP) analysis of a concatenated plastid dataset recovered well-resolved trees that are topologically similar, with many clades supported by unique indels. MP and Bayesian analyses of the ITS sequence data recovered trees that have several well-supported topological differences, both among analyses, and to trees inferred from the plastid data. The most substantial of these concerns A. vulneraria and A. lemanniana, whose placement in the parsimony analysis of the ITS data appears to be due to a strong long-branch effect. Analysis of the secondary structure of the ITS1 spacer showed a strong bias towards transitions in A. vulneraria and A. lemanniana, many of which were also characteristic of certain outgroup taxa. This may contribute to the conflicting placement of this clade in the MP tree for the ITS data. Additional conflicts between the plastid and ITS trees were more taxonomically focused. These differences may reflect the occurrence of reticulate evolution between closely related species, including a possible hybrid origin for A. hystrix. The patterns of incongruence between the plastid and the ITS data seem to correlate with taxon ranks. All of our phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of Anthyllis (incl. Hymenocarpos). Although they are often taxonomically associated with Anthyllis, the genera Dorycnopsis and Tripodion are shown here to be more closely related to other genera of Loteae. We infer up to six major clades in Anthyllis that are morphologically well-characterized, and which could be recognized as sections. Four of these agree with various morphology-based classifications, while the other two are novel. We reconstruct the evolution of several morphological characteristics found only in Anthyllis or tribe Loteae. Some of these characters support major clades, while others show evidence of homoplasy within Anthyllis.},

At least six different stylar types are known in the tribe. In order to reclassify the tribe at the rank of genus, we tried to discover apomorphies in stylar features using a molecular phylogenetic study. We surveyed internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA of representative species, selected from each group having different types of styles in the tribe. We paid particular attention in sampling to members of Vicia section Vicilla, as stylar features are heterogeneous within this section. Consequently, our sample set included 15 species of section Vicilla, 23 species of other Fabeae, and two species of Trifolieae, which were used as a sister group of Fabeae. Based on our analysis, we found that a laterally compressed style and an abaxially tufted hairy style would be advanced against a dorsiventrally compressed style and an evenly hairy style, respectively, in genus Vicia. The species group, which shares the latter apomorphy, is composed of 56 species and was dispersed into 11 sections of two subgenera in the recent system of genus Vicia. We consider future revision of Fabeae should treat this species group as a single higher taxon.},

We used nrDNA ITS to investigate the phylogeny of the genus, and AFLP markers (9 primers, 20 populations) to establish the genetic relationship between subspecies, and among populations at each side of the Gibraltar Strait. According to nrDNA ITS, Erophaca is monophyletic, old (Miocene), and sister to the Astragalean clade. Life form attributes and molecular clock estimates suggest that Erophaca is one of the many Tertiary relicts that form part of the present Mediterranean flora. Within the occidental subspecies, European plants are clearly derived from North-African populations (Morocco) which, despite being rare on a regional scale, present the highest genetic diversity (as estimated by private and rare fragment numbers). In general, genetic diversity decreased with increasing distance from Morocco. AFLP and nrDNA ITS markers evidenced that the Eastern and the Western subspecies are genetically distinct. Possible causes for their disjunct distribution are discussed.},

	abstract = {Recent deep-level phylogenies of the basal papilionoid legumes (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae) have resolved many clades, yet left the phylogenetic placement of several genera unassessed. The phylogenetically enigmatic Amazonian monospecific genus Petaladenium had been believed to be close to the genera of the Genistoid Ormosieae clade. In this paper we provide the first DNA phylogenetic study of Petaladenium and show it is not part of the large Genistoid clade, but is a new branch of the Amburaneae clade, one of the first-diverging lineages of the Papilionoideae phylogeny. This result is supported by the chemical observation that the quinolizidine alkaloids, a chemical synapomorphy of the Genistoids, are absent in Petaladenium. Parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ITS/5.8S and plastid matK and trnL intron agree with a new interpretation of morphology that Petaladenium is sister to Dussia, a genus comprising ∼18 species of trees largely confined to rainforests in Central America and northern South America. Petaladenium, Dussia, and Myrospermum have papilionate flowers in a clade otherwise with radial floral symmetry, loss of petals or incompletely differentiated petals. Our phylogenetic analyses also revealed well-supported resolution within the three main lineages of the ADA clade (Angylocalyceae, Dipterygeae, and Amburaneae). We also discuss further molecular phylogenetic evidence for the undersampled Amazonian genera Aldina and Monopteryx, and the tropical African Amphimas, Cordyla, Leucomphalos, and Mildbraediodendron.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF STUDY Phylogenetic relationships of the papilionoid legumes (Papilionoideae) reveal that the early branches are more highly diverse in floral morphology than are other clades of Papilionoideae. This study attempts for the first time to comprehensively sample the early-branching clades of this economically and ecologically important legume subfamily and thus to resolve relationships among them. • METHODS Parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the plastid matK and trnL intron sequences included 29 genera not yet sampled in matK phylogenies of the Papilionoideae, 11 of which were sampled for DNA sequence data for the first time. • KEY RESULTS The comprehensively sampled matK phylogeny better resolved the deep-branching relationships and increased support for many clades within Papilionoideae. The potentially earliest-branching papilionoid clade does not include any genus traditionally assigned to tribe Swartzieae. Dipterygeae is monophyletic with the inclusion of Monopteryx. The genera Aldina and Amphimas represent two of the nine main but as yet unresolved lineages comprising the large 50-kb inversion clade within papilionoids. The quinolizidine-alkaloid-accumulating genistoid clade is expanded to include a strongly supported subclade containing Ormosia and the previously unplaced Clathrotropis s.s., Panurea, and Spirotropis. Camoensia is the first-branching genus of the core genistoids. • CONCLUSIONS The well-resolved phylogeny of the earliest-branching papilionoids generated in this study will greatly facilitate the efforts to redefine and stabilize the classification of this legume subfamily. Many key floral traits did not often predict phylogenetic relationships, so comparative studies on floral evolution and plant-animal interactions, for example, should also benefit from this study.},

	doi = {10.3732/ajb.1200276},
	abstract = {PREMISE OF STUDY Flowering traits can sometimes be overemphasized in taxonomic classifications. The fused and completely differentiated papilionate floral organs in the neotropical legume trees Vatairea and Vataireopsis were traditionally used in part to ascribe these genera to the tribe Dalbergieae. In contrast, the free and mostly undifferentiated floral parts of Luetzelburgia and Sweetia fit the circumscription of the "primitive" Sophoreae. Such divergent floral morphologies thought to divide deep phylogenetic lineages indeed may be prone to episodic transformation among close papilionoid relatives. METHODS We sampled 26 of 27 known species of Luetzelburgia, Sweetia, Vatairea, and Vataireopsis in parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal ITS/5.8S and six plastid (matK, 3'-trnK, psbA-trnH, trnL intron, rps16 intron, and trnD-T) DNA sequence loci. KEY RESULTS The analyses of individual and combined data sets strongly resolved the monophyly of each of Luetzelburgia, Sweetia, Vatairea, and Vataireopsis. Vataireopsis was resolved as sister to the rest and the morphologically divergent Luetzelburgia and Vatairea were strongly resolved as sister clades. Floral morphology was generally not a good predictor of phylogenetic relatedness. CONCLUSIONS Luetzelburgia, Sweetia, Vatairea, and Vataireopsis are unequivocally resolved as the "vataireoid" clade. Fruit and vegetative traits are found to be more phylogenetically conserved than many floral traits. This explains why the identity of the vataireoids has been overlooked or confused. The evolvability of floral traits may also be a general condition among many of the early-branching papilionoid lineages.},

Despite a superficial resemblance between Haplormosia and Ormosia, a re-examination of the morphology of Haplormosia corroborates the new phylogenetic result. The reciprocally monophyletic deep divergence of the Haplormosia stem lineage from the remaining Brongniartieae is dated to ca. 52Mya, thus supporting a signature of an old single long-distance dispersal during the early Eocene. Conversely, we estimated a relatively recent long-distance dispersal rooted in the Early Miocene for the Australian Brongniartieae clade emerging from within a grade of American Brongniartieae.

	abstract = {The systematics of Mimosoideae has been in a state of flux, which reflects overall poor knowledge of the evolution and biogeography of this group. Preliminary molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest the tribal system of Mimosoideae needs a complete revision. This has led to the use of new generic names for Acacia sensu lato (s.l. hereafter) following the re-typification of Acacia with an Australian type: (i) Acacia sensu stricto (s.s. hereafter), Vachellia, Senegalia, Acaciella and Mariosousa. This study reconstructs the evolutionary history of Mimosoideae, using the most comprehensive sampling to date, with an emphasis on African species. It aims to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the five recognized genera within Acacieae as the precursor to elucidate the paleo-biogeography of mimosoids and their adaptation to open habitats in the Cenozoic. The basal position of Mimoseae lineages with regards to Vachellia and Senegalia+Mariosousa+Acaciella+Ingeae+Acacia s.s. clades is a novel finding. Vachellia (formerly Acacia subgenus Acacia) is found monophyletic. A grade including the remaining Mimoseae lineages is found sister to the Senegalia+Mariosousa+Acaciella+Ingeae+Acacia s.s. clade. The major clades originated in the late Oligocene-early Miocene (∼25mya). The transitions from close to open habitats occurred during the Miocene for at least four mimosoid lineages. These are interpreted as responses to increased seasonality leading to fire climates and drying trends in the Miocene, which allowed the expansion of open habitats, such as savannas, worldwide.},

Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of internal transcribed spacer sequences identify a well-supported northwest African-Cape Verde Island clade that includes all members of Lotus subgenus Pedrosia+L. subg. Rhyncholotus. There is modest support for two independently nested clades containing the Canary Island species and two non-Canarian species, Lotus assakensis from Africa and Lotus azoricus endemic to the Azores. Biogeographic reconstruction based on a parsimony topology unequivocally identifies an African origin for the Canary Island group with subsequent back dispersal to the African continent and a single dispersal event to the Azores.

	abstract = {Plant monoterpenes are a diverse class of secondary metabolites mediating biotic and abiotic interactions with direct effects on plant fitness. To evaluate the hypothesis that monoterpene diversity is related to functional diversification after gene duplication, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of monoterpene synthases (TPSb)--the genes underlying monoterpene synthesis--in Protium, a taxonomically and chemically diverse genus of tropical trees. We isolated multiple copies of TPSb genes from chemically divergent Protium species, reconstructed the phylogeny of this gene family, used maximum-likelihood estimation of selection coefficients, and inferred residues evolving under positive selection. We found evidence for one ancient and multiple more recent duplication events giving rise to three, and potentially five, copies of TPSb genes currently present in Protium. There was evidence for adaptive evolution in one copy with a positively selected residue likely involved in protein folding and product specificity. All other copies were inferred to be evolving under a combination of stabilizing and/or relaxed selection. Although gene copy number is consistent with the extensive phenotypic diversity in monoterpenes shown in Protium, selection analyses suggest that not all copies are undergoing divergent selection consistent with a coevolutionary arms race with enemies, but instead may be under stabilizing and relaxed selection consistent with signaling or physiological stress functionality.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY The Chamaesyce clade of Euphorbia is the largest lineage of C(4) plants among the eudicots, with 350 species including both narrow endemics and cosmopolitan weeds. We sampled this group worldwide to address questions about subclade relationships, the origin of C(4) photosynthesis, the evolution of weeds, and the role of hybridization and long-distance dispersal in the diversification of the group. • METHODS Two nuclear (ITS and exon 9 of EMB2765) and three chloroplast markers (matK, rpl16, and trnL-F) were sequenced for 138 ingroup and six outgroup species. Exon 9 of EMB2765 was cloned in accessions with {\textgreater}1\% superimposed peaks. • KEY RESULTS The Chamaesyce clade is monophyletic and consists of three major subclades [1(2,3)]: (1) the Acuta clade, containing three North American species with C(3) photosynthesis and C(3)-C(4) intermediates; (2) the Peplis clade, mostly North American and entirely C(4); and (3) the Hypericifolia clade, all C(4), with both New World and Old World groups. Incongruence between chloroplast and ITS phylogenies and divergent cloned copies of EMB2765 exon 9 suggest extensive hybridization, especially in the Hawaiian Islands radiation. • CONCLUSIONS The Chamaesyce clade originated in warm, arid areas of North America, where it evolved C(4) photosynthesis. From there, it diversified globally with extensive reticulate evolution and frequent long-distance dispersals. Although many species are weedy, there are numerous local adaptations to specific substrates and regional or island radiations, which have contributed to the great diversity of this group.},

Sampling includes representatives of all three subfamilies (Acalyphoideae, Crotonoideae, and Euphorbioideae), 35 of 37 tribes and 179 of the 247 genera of uniovulate Euphorbiaceae sensu lato (s.l.). Euphorbiaceae s.s. were recovered as a monophyletic group with no new adjustments in circumscription. Two clades containing taxa previously placed in Acalyphoideae are found to be successive sisters to all other Euphorbiaceae s.s. and are proposed here at subfamilial rank as Peroideae and Cheilosoideae. The remainder of the family fall into seven major lineages including Erismantheae and Acalyphoideae s.s. (parts of Acalyphoideae), Adenoclineae s.l., Gelonieae, articulated crotonoids and inaperturate crotonoids (parts of Crotonoideae), and Euphorbioideae. Potential synapomorphies and biogeographical trends are suggested for these clades. Acalyphoideae s.s., inaperturate crotonoids, and Euphorbioideae tribe Hippomaneae each have two major subclades that represent novel groupings without apparent morphological synapomorphies. Two subfamilies, 14 tribes, and 10 genera were found to be para- or polyphyletic. Noteworthy among these, Omphaleae are embedded in Adenoclineae, Hureae + Pachystromateae in Hippomaneae, Ditta in Tetrorchidium, and Sapium s.s. in Stillingia.},

A palisadal exotegmen is a possible synapomorphy for all the Euphorbiaceae, except for the subfamily Peroideae. The presence of vascular bundles in the inner integument and a thick inner integument were shown to be synapomorphies for the clade of inaperturate and articulated crotonoids and for the large clade of Euphorbioideae, Acalyphoideae s.s., inaperturate and articulated crotonoids, respectively. Characters of the aril and vascular bundles in the outer integument are discussed. The selected embryological characters were seen to be highly correlated with the molecular phylogeny.

The analyses demonstrated the monophyly of Macaranga and the paraphyly of Mallotus and revealed three highly supported main clades. The genera Cordemoya and Deuteromallotus and the Mallotus sections Hancea and Oliganthae form a basal Cordemoya s.l. clade. The two other clades, the Macaranga clade and the Mallotus s.s. clade (the latter with Coccoceras, Neotrewia, Octospermum, and Trewia), are sister groups. In the Macaranga clade, two basal lineages (comprising mostly sect. Pseudorottlera) and a crown group with three geographically homogenous main clades were identified. The phylogeny of the Mallotus s.s. clade is less clear because of internal conflict in all four data sets. Many of the sections and informal infrageneric groups of Macaranga and Mallotus do not appear to be monophyletic. In both the Macaranga and Mallotus s.s. clades, the African and/or Madagascan taxa are nested in Asian clades, suggesting migrations or dispersals from Asia to Africa and Madagascar.},

	abstract = {Species-level phylogenies derived from many independent character sources and wide geographical sampling provide a powerful tool in assessing the importance of various factors associated with cladogenesis. In this study, we explore the relative importance of insular isolation and host plant switching in the diversification of a group of bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) feeding and breeding in woody Euphor biaspurges. All species in the genus Aphanarthrumare each associated with only one species group of Euphorbia(succulents or one of three different arborescent groups), and the majority of species are endemic to one or several of the Macaronesian Islands. Hence, putative mechanisms of speciation could be assessed by identifying pairs of sister species in a phylogenetic analysis. We used DNA sequences from two nuclear and two mitochondrial genes, and morphological characters, to reconstruct the genealogical relationships among 92 individuals of 25 species and subspecies of Aphanarthrumand related genera. A stable tree topology was highly dependent on multiple character sources, but much less so on wide population sampling. However, multiple samples per species demonstrated one case of species paraphyly, as well as deep coalescence among three putative subspecies pairs. The phylogenetic analyses consistently placed the arborescent breeding and West African--Lanzarote-distributed species A. armatumin the most basal position in Aphanarthrum, rendering this genus paraphyletic with respect to Coleobothrus. Two major radiations followed, one predominantly African lineage of succulent feeding species, and one island radiation associated with arborescent host plants. Sister comparisons showed that most recent divergences occurred in allopatry on closely related hosts, with subsequent expansions obscuring more ancient events. Only 6 out of 24 cladogenetic events were associated with host switching, rendering geographical factors more important in recent diversification.},

To clarify phylogenetic relationships in the genus, we used maximum likelihood, bayesian, and parsimony analyses of DNA sequence data from 10 markers representing all three plant genomes, averaging more than 16kbp for each accession. Taxon sampling included 176 representatives from Euphorbioideae (including 161 of Euphorbia). Analyses of these data robustly resolve a backbone topology of four major, subgeneric clades--Esula, Rhizanthium, Euphorbia, and Chamaesyce--that are successively sister lineages. Ancestral state reconstructions of six reproductive and growth form characters indicate that the earliest Euphorbia species were likely woody, non-succulent plants with helically arranged leaves and 5-glanded cyathia in terminal inflorescences. The highly modified growth forms and reproductive features in Euphorbia have independent origins within the subgeneric clades. Examples of extreme parallelism in trait evolution include at least 14 origins of xeromorphic growth forms and at least 13 origins of seed caruncles. The evolution of growth form and inflorescence position are significantly correlated, and a pathway of evolutionary transitions is supported that has implications for the evolution of Euphorbia xerophytes of large stature. Such xerophytes total more than 400 species and are dominants of vegetation types throughout much of arid Africa and Madagascar.},

In Europe, it is represented by more than 100 species with highest diversity in the Mediterranean area; the majority of taxa belong to subgenus Esula Pers., including about 500 taxa. The few available phylogenetic studies yielded contrasting results regarding the monophyly of subg. Esula, and the phylogenetic relationships among its constituents remain poorly understood. We have sampled DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the plastid trnT-trnF region from about 100, predominantly European taxa of subg. Esula in order to infer its phylogenetic history. The plastid data support monophyly of subg. Esula whereas the ITS phylogeny, which is generally less resolved, is indecisive in this respect. Although some major clades have partly incongruent positions in the ITS and plastid phylogenies, the taxonomic content of the major terminal clades is congruent in both trees. As traditional sectional delimitations are largely not corroborated, an improved classification is proposed. Character state reconstruction illustrates that the annual life form developed independently several times in different clades of subgenus Esula from perennial ancestors, and that several morphological traits used in previous classifications of Euphorbia developed in parallel in different lineages.},

	abstract = {From a phylogenetic perspective, the genus Manihot can be considered as an orphan group of plants, and the scientific knowledge acquired has been mainly related to cassava, one of the most important crops in poor tropical countries. The goal of the majority of evolutionary studies in the genus has been to decipher the domestication process and identify the closest relatives of cassava. Few investigations have focused on wild Manihot species, and the phylogeny of the genus is still unclear. In this study the DNA sequence variation from two chloroplast regions, the nuclear DNA gene G3pdh and two nuclear sequences derived from the 3'-end of two cassava ESTs, were used in order to infer the phylogenetic relationships among a subset of wild Manihot species, including two species from Cnidoscolus as out-groups. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses were conducted for each data set and for a combined matrix due to the low variation of each region when analyzed independently. A penalized likelihood analysis of the chloroplast region trnL-trnF, calibrated with various age estimates for genera in the Euphorbiaceae extracted from the literature was used to determine the ages of origin and diversification of the genus. The two Mesoamerican species sampled form a well-defined clade. The South American species can be grouped into clades of varying size, but the relationships amongst them cannot be established with the data available. The age of the crown node of Manihot was estimated at 6.6 million years ago. Manihot esculenta varieties do not form a monophyletic group that is consistent with the possibility of multiple introgressions of genes from other wild species. The low levels of variation observed in the DNA regions sampled suggest a recent and explosive diversification of the genus, which is confirmed by our age estimates.},

	abstract = {Many species of the paleotropical pioneer tree genus Macaranga Thou. (Euphorbiaceae) live in association with ants. Various types of mutualistic interactions exist, ranging from the attraction of unspecific ant visitors to obligate myrmecophytism. In the latter, nesting space and food bodies are exchanged for protection by highly specific ant partners (mainly species of the myrmicine genus Crematogaster). As a first step toward elucidating the coevolution of ant-plant interactions in the Macaranga-Crematogaster system, we have initiated a molecular investigation of the plant partners' phylogeny. Nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were analyzed for 73 accessions from 47 Macaranga species, representing 17 sections or informally described species groups. Three accessions from the putative sister taxon Mallotus Lour, were included as outgroups. Cladograms of the ITS data revealed Macaranga to be nested within Mallotus. ITS sequences are highly similar within section Pachystemon s.str., suggesting a relatively recent and rapid radiation of obligate myrmecophytes within this section. Forty-three accessions, mainly of ant-inhabited species, were additionally investigated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite-primed PCR (MP-PCR) techniques. Phenetic analysis of RAPD and MP-PCR banding profiles generally confirmed the ITS results. Best resolutions for individual clades were obtained when ITS and RAPD/MP-PCR data were combined into a single matrix and analyzed phenetically. The combined analysis suggests multiple (four) rather than a single evolutionary origin of myrmecophytism, at least one reversal from obligate myrmecophytism to nonmyrmecophytism, and one loss of mutualistic specifity.},

The second is entirely Old World and is sister to a third, also entirely New World clade, which is composed of at least 13 of Webster's sections of Croton. This study establishes a phylogenetic framework for future studies in the hyper-diverse genus Croton, indicates a New World origin for the genus, and will soon be used to evaluate wood anatomical, cytological, and morphological data in the Crotoneae tribe.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY The mountains of South America are hotspots of plant diversity. How this diversity originated and evolved, and what roles geographic and environmental factors may have played in the diversification of lineages occurring in these regions, is not well understood. Escallonia, a morphologically and ecologically diverse group of shrubs and trees widely distributed in these mountains, provides an ideal opportunity for studying the historical underpinnings that have shaped the extraordinarily distinctive, diverse, and endangered flora of these regions, and for evaluating the role of abiotic factors in the process of lineage divergence. • METHODS I analyzed neutral DNA sequence data from two nuclear loci and one chloroplast locus using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian phylogenetic approaches. I used a Bayesian approach to analyze the geographic structure of gene trees, and a phylogenetically controlled decomposition of the variance in bioclimatic variables to analyze the eco-climatic structure of gene trees. • KEY RESULTS I found that Escallonia (1) is monophyletic, (2) has a remarkable level of geographic and climatic phylogenetic structure, (3) likely originated in the tropical Andes, and (4) has a widespread absence of species exclusivity. • CONCLUSIONS Geography played an important role early in the history of Escallonia by separating populations that later diversify likely in isolation. Although geographic isolation was generally accompanied by changes in climate, it is not clear whether environmental gradients along elevation have influenced more recent diversification events or whether species have evolved broader environmental tolerances.},

	abstract = {Inferring interfamilial relationships within the eudicot order Ericales has remained one of the more recalcitrant problems in angiosperm phylogenetics, likely due to a rapid, ancient radiation. As a result, no comprehensive time-calibrated tree or biogeographical analysis of the order has been published. Here, we elucidate phylogenetic relationships within the order and then conduct time-dependent biogeographical and diversification analyses by using a taxon and locus-rich supermatrix approach on one-third of the extant species diversity calibrated with 23 macrofossils and two secondary calibration points. Our results corroborate previous studies and also suggest several new but poorly supported relationships. Newly suggested relationships are: (1) holoparasitic Mitrastemonaceae is sister to Lecythidaceae, (2) the clade formed by Mitrastemonaceae + Lecythidaceae is sister to Ericales excluding balsaminoids, (3) Theaceae is sister to the styracoids + sarracenioids + ericoids, and (4) subfamilial relationships with Ericaceae suggest that Arbutoideae is sister to Monotropoideae and Pyroloideae is sister to all subfamilies excluding Arbutoideae, Enkianthoideae, and Monotropoideae. Our results indicate Ericales began to diversify 110 Mya, within Indo-Malaysia and the Neotropics, with exchange between the two areas and expansion out of Indo-Malaysia becoming an important area in shaping the extant diversity of many families. Rapid cladogenesis occurred along the backbone of the order between 104 and 106 Mya. Jump dispersal is important within the order in the last 30 My, but vicariance is the most important cladogenetic driver of disjunctions at deeper levels of the phylogeny. We detect between 69 and 81 shifts in speciation rate throughout the order, the vast majority of which occurred within the last 30 My. We propose that range shifting may be responsible for older shifts in speciation rate, but more recent shifts may be better explained by morphological innovation.},

	abstract = {Gaultheria series Trichophyllae Airy Shaw is an angiosperm clade of high-alpine shrublets endemic to the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains and characterized by recent species divergence and convergent character evolution that has until recently caused much confusion in species circumscription. Although multiple DNA sequence regions have been employed previously, phylogenetic relationships among species in the group have remained largely unresolved. Here we examined the effectiveness of the plastid genome for improving phylogenetic resolution within the G. series Trichophyllae clade. Plastid genomes of 31 samples representing all 19 recognized species of the series and three outgroup species were sequenced with Illumina Sequencing technology. Maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenetic analyses were performed with various datasets, i.e., that from the whole plastid genome, coding regions, noncoding regions, large single-copy region (LSC) and inverted-repeat region a (IRa). The partitioned whole plastid genome with inverted-repeat region b (IRb) excluded was also analyzed with ML and BI. Tree topologies based on the whole plastid genome, noncoding regions, and LSC region datasets across all analyses, and that based on the partitioned dataset with ML and BI analyses, are identical and generally strongly supported. Gaultheria series Trichophyllae form a clade with three species and one variety that is sister to a clade of the remaining 16 species; the latter comprises seven main subclades. Interspecific relationships within the series are strongly supported except for those based on the coding-region and IRa-region datasets. Eight divergence hotspot regions, each possessing {\textgreater}5\% percent variable sites, were screened across the whole plastid genome of the 28 individuals sampled in the series. Results of morphological character evolution reconstruction diagnose several clades, and a hypothesis of adaptive evolution for plant habit is postulated.},

	abstract = {Taxonomic treatment of the achlorophyllous monotropoid plant Monotropastrum humile is still unclear and confusing because of the lack of detailed morphological analyses and molecular phylogeny. In particular, the taxonomic status of a glabrous variety, M. humile var. glaberrimum, is under debate. Our detailed examination of the morphological characteristics of living plants revealed that M. humile var. glaberrimum can be easily distinguished from the putative conspecific taxon M. humile var. humile by characteristics not previously recognized, namely the shape and color of the floral disc. Most morphological features characterizing Cheilotheca were also found in M. humile var. glaberrimum. Moreover, there was considerable nucleotide differentiation in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)2 sequences of M. humile var. humile and var. glaberrimum. Molecular analysis of the phylogenetic relationship of M. humile var. humile, var. glaberrimum, and other monotropoids using ITS2 sequences showed that two varieties of M. humile formed a monophyletic clade with a member of a different genus, Monotropa L., but obvious phylogenetic relationships among these three taxa were not obtained. Thus we conclude that Monotropastrum humile var. glaberrimum should be treated as a distinct species. However, the generic affiliation of M. humile var. glaberrimum could not be determined because of its intermediate character state combination and the insufficient characterization of related species. We strongly suggest that Monotropastrum as a whole needs re-evaluation.},

	abstract = {Mountains are often more species-rich than lowlands. This could be the result of migration from lowlands to mountains, of a greater survival rate in mountains, or of a higher diversification rate in mountains. We investigated this question in the globally distributed family Ericaceae, which includes c. 4426 species ranging from sea level to {\textgreater} 5000 m. We predict that the interaction of low specific leaf area (SLA) and montane habitats is correlated with increased diversification rates. A molecular phylogeny of Ericaceae based on rbcL and matK sequence data was built and dated with 18 fossil calibrations and divergence time estimates. We identified radiations using bamm and correlates of diversification rate changes using binary-state speciation and extinction (BiSSE) and multiple-state speciation and extinction (MuSSE) analyses. Analyses revealed six largely montane radiations. Lineages in mountains diversified faster than nonmountain lineages (higher speciation rate, but no difference in extinction rate), and lineages with low SLA diversified faster than high-SLA lineages. Further, habitat and trait had a positive interactive effect on diversification. Our results suggest that the species richness in mountains is the result of increased speciation rather than reduced extinction or increased immigration. Increased speciation in Ericaceae was facilitated by low SLA.},

	abstract = {The origins and evolutionary history of the New Zealand flora has been the subject of much debate. The recent description of Cyathodophyllum novaezelandieae from early Miocene sediments in New Zealand provides possible evidence for the antiquity of the fleshy fruited epacrids (tribe Styphelieae, Ericaceae) in New Zealand. Yet the extant species in this tribe are thought to be very closely related to or conspecific with Australian taxa, suggesting recent trans-Tasman origins. In order to investigate the origins and evolution of the extant New Zealand Styphelieae we produced molecular phylogenetic trees based on sequences of three plastid regions that include representatives of all the genera of the tribe and eight of the ten New Zealand species. We estimated the range of minimum ages of the New Zealand lineages with Bayesian relaxed-clock analyses using different calibration methods and relative dating. We found strong support for each of the eight extant species of New Zealand Styphelieae being a distinct lineage that is nested within an Australian clade. In all except one case the sister is from Tasmania and/or the east coast of mainland Australia; for Acrothamnus colensoi the sister is in New Guinea. Estimated dates indicate that all of the New Zealand lineages diverged from their non-New Zealand sisters within the last 7 Ma. Time discontinuity between the fossil C.novae-zelandiae (20-23 Ma) and the origins of the extant New Zealand lineages (none older than 5 Ma) indicates that the fossil and extant Styphelieae in New Zealand are not related. The relative dating analysis showed that to accept this relationship, it would be necessary to accept that the Styphelieae arose in the early-mid Mesozoic (210-120 Ma), which is starkly at odds with multiple lines of evidence on the age of Ericales and indeed the angiosperms. Therefore, our results do not support the hypothesis that Styphelieae have been continuously present in New Zealand since the early Miocene. Instead they suggest a historical biogeographical scenario in which the lineage to which C. novae-zelandiae belongs went extinct in New Zealand, and the extant New Zealand Styphelieae are derived from Australian lineages that recolonised (presumably by long distance dispersal) no earlier than the late Miocene to Pliocene.},

Erica is taxonomically well documented, but very little is known about species-level relationships. We present the first densely sampled phylogenetic analysis of Erica, using nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (internal transcribed spacers; ITS) of c. 45\% of the species from across the full geographic range of the genus, both Calluna and Daboecia (Ericeae; monotypic genera and putative sister groups of Erica), and further Ericoideae outgroups. Our results show both morphological and geographic coherence of some clades, but numerous shifts in floral macro-morphology as represented by variation in individual morphological characters and pollination syndromes. European Ericeae is a paraphyletic grade subtending a monophyletic African/Malagasy Erica. Given the limited resolution of this single gene tree, more data are needed for further conclusions.

This is particularly important, as the monophyly of many of the studied genera have not been confirmed.

Anthopterus, Demosthenesia, and Pellegrinia are among the putative Andean genera recovered as monophyletic, while other eight Andean genera were not. The analyses also showed that genera that have been traditionally widely defined are non-monophyletic and could be further split into more discrete groups. Four newly discovered Colombian Vaccinieae are placed in the monophyletic Satyria s.s. and the Psammisia I clade.

We present phylogenetic hypotheses for the major clades of Ericeae represented by multiple accessions of all northern Erica species and placeholder taxa for the large nested African/Madagascan clade. We identified consistent, strongly supported conflict between gene trees inferred from ITS and chloroplast DNA sequences with regard to the position of Erica lusitanica. We used coalescent simulations to test whether this conflict could be explained by coalescent stochasticity, as opposed to reticulation (e.g. hybridisation), given estimates of clade ages, generation time and effective population sizes (Ne). A standard approach, comparing overall differences between real and simulated trees, could not clearly reject coalescence. However, additional simulations showed that at the (higher) Ne necessary to explain conflict in E. lusitanica, further topological conflict would also be expected. Ancient hybridisation between ancestors of northern species is therefore a plausible scenario to explain the origin of E. lusitanica, and its morphological similarities to E. arborea. Assuming either process influences the results of species tree and further evolutionary inference. The coalescence scenario is equivocal with regard the standing hypothesis of stepping stone dispersal of Erica from Europe into Africa; whereas reticulate evolution in E. lusitanica would imply that the colonisation of Tropical East Africa by E. arborea instead occurred independently of dispersals within the rest of the African/Madagascan clade.},

We explore the relative utility of supertree and supermatrix approaches for addressing this challenge, and examine the effects of missing data on tree topology and resolution. Although the supertree approach returned a more conservative hypothesis, overall, both supermatrix and supertree analyses concurred in the topologies they returned. Using multiple genes and a dataset of variably complete taxa we found improved support for the monophyly and position of the tribes and genus level relationships. However, there was mixed support for the Richeeae tribe appearing one node basal to the Cosmelieae tribe or vice versa. It is probable that this will only be resolved through further sequencing. Our study supports previous findings that the amount of data is more critical than the completeness of the dataset in estimating well-resolved trees. Our results suggest that a "serendipitous" scaffolding approach that includes a mixture of well and poorly sequenced taxa can lead to robust phylogenetic hypotheses.},

	volume = {203},
	doi = {10.1111/nph.12863},
	abstract = {Following climate cooling at the end of the Tertiary, arctic-alpine plants attained most of their extant species diversity. Because East Asia was not heavily glaciated, the importance of this region as a location for the long-term persistence of these species and their subsequent endemism during the Pleistocene was proposed in early discussions of phytogeography. However, this hypothesis remains to be fully tested. Here, we address this hypothesis by elucidating the phylogenetic history of Phyllodoce (Ericaceae). A phylogenetic tree based on multiple nuclear loci revealed that Phyllodoce nipponica was not derived from widespread species such as the arctic-alpine Phyllodoce caerulea, but rather represented an independent lineage sister to the clade of widespread relatives. Molecular dating indicated a mid-Pleistocene divergence of P. nipponica. These findings exclude the hypothesis that P. nipponica was derived from an arctic-alpine species that extended its range southwards during recent glacial periods. Instead, our results support the hypothesis that P. nipponica is an ancestral species which persisted in the Japanese archipelago during the mid- and late Pleistocene. Our findings demonstrate support for the early proposal and shed light on the importance of the Japanese archipelago for the evolution and persistence of arctic-alpine species.},

	abstract = {Many arctic-alpine plants display a highly disjunct distribution between the Arctic/Boreal regions and the southern Asian mountains. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of this biogeographic pattern: (1) south-to-north migration in the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene, and (2) north-to-south migration during the Miocene. The genus Cassiope is disjunctly distributed between the Arctic/Boreal regions and the Himalayan-Hengduan Mountains (HHM) and was selected to test these hypotheses. We constructed a fossil-calibrated phylogeny of Ericaceae using two plastid regions to estimate the crown group age of Cassiope, and used sequence data from thousands of loci produced by restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to reconstruct the phylogeny of Cassiope. We also performed Bayesian divergence time analysis and biogeographic analysis. The Cassiope crown group was estimated to have originated in the Miocene, which predates the onset of Northern hemisphere glaciation. All HHM species formed a clade together with one eastern Siberian species, and this clade was sister to all other Arctic/Boreal species. This topology implies a northern origin of Cassiope, which is confirmed by our biogeographic analysis. Our results thus suggest that the ancient north-to-south migration hypothesis is most consistent with the origin of Cassiope.},

We tested for phylogenetic signal in the phenological components and related traits among Himalayan Rhododendron species. METHODS We constructed a phylogeny with trnL-trnL-trnF, atpH-I, RPB2-I (3F-4R), and ITS 4-5, and examined it in combination with trait data recorded for a nine-species assemblage on Mt. Yulong, Yunnan, China. KEY RESULTS Uniquely among phenological traits, 'last flowering day' had a significant phylogenetic signal. Last flowering day was latest in the clade with the smallest fruits. A similar association between the end of flowering and reproductive investment existed in data from Flora of China (Wu et al., 2005) for 160 Yunnan Rhododendron species, for which last flowering month was correlated with fruit size. CONCLUSIONS Phylogenetic determinants of last flowering day and fruit size may be driven by limited time for fruit development before the onset of cold temperatures in autumn-a temporal niche that only small-fruited species can occupy. This strategy is analogous to 'fast and cheap' spring ephemerals. More may be gained from late-phenology studies, both within and among species and across seasons.},

Relationships involving the deepest nodes have been difficult to resolve, limiting the potential for further cladistic studies within the Ericoideae.

Two large clades were discovered. One clade includes the Phyllodoceae and Bejaria. The sister clade includes the Empetreae+Diplarche, Ericeae, Rhodoreae, and a clade comprised of Bryanthus and Ledothamnus. The current study improves upon the resolution of the phylogeny of the Ericoideae, particularly demonstrating support for the deepest nodes. Based on these results, we propose to retain the Ericeae, expand the Phyllodoceae to include Bejaria, expand the Empetreae to include Diplarche, retain the Rhodoreae (without Diplarche), dismantle the Bejarieae, and construct a new tribe, Bryantheae (Bryanthus and Ledothamnus).},

Parsimony analyses were conducted on these data, as well as on a complementary rbcL sequence dataset assembled from the literature and the combined dataset. The atpbeta-rbcL spacer was notable for the high frequency of insertion-deletion mutations (indels); their distributions were coded as binary characters and included as a adjunct matrix in some of the analyses. The phylogenetic patterns derived from the spacer and rbcL data and the combined analyses, both including and excluding the indel data, concur in resolving seven major lineages corresponding to the tribes of Crayn et al. (1998, Aust. J. Bot. 46, 187-200), viz. Prionoteae, Archerieae, Oligarrheneae, Cosmelieae, Richeeae, Epacrideae, and Styphelieae. The relationships of the tribes and within Styphelieae, however, are not convincingly resolved. Minor conflicts in the positions of some taxa between the spacer and the rbcL trees are poorly supported. Among epacrids, the spacer region provided more cladistically informative characters than rbcL and resulted in trees with lower homoplasy. Further, the spacer data, when analyzed alone and when combined with rbcL, resolved several clades that could not be retrieved on rbcL data alone and provided increased support for many other relationships. The evolution of a putative three-base inversion associated with a hairpin secondary structure in the spacer region is discussed in the light of the inferred phylogeny.},

In total, 124 individuals from five endemic Rhododendron species were used for amplifications of two chloroplast intergenic spacers: trnL-trnF and atpB-rbcL. The haplotype and nucleotide diversities were much lower for the R. pseudochrysanthum complex, comprised of the species R. pseudochrysanthum, R. morii, Rhododendron rubropunctatum, and Rhododendron hyperythrum, than for Rhododendron formosanum. Two measures of pairwise population differentiation, N(ST) and F(ST), consistently revealed mostly non-significant levels of genetic divergence between populations of the R. pseudochrysanthum complex. No genetic difference was found among the four species of the R. pseudochrysanthum complex by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), which is concordant with the parsimonious topology of cpDNA haplotypes for the complex. Nested clade analysis (NCA) of the cpDNA haplotypes indicated that restricted gene flow with isolation-by-distance characterized the recolonization pattern of the R. pseudochrysanthum complex. In contrast, the NCA analysis indicated a contiguous range expansion for cpDNA haplotypes of R. formosanum. This research suggests a once-widespread distribution of the R. pseudochrysanthum complex probably via north-to-south colonization of mid-elevations during low-temperature periods of the Pleistocene. Population fragmentation followed the warmer climate which began in the Holocene and resulted in the present-day range contraction into high elevations.},

	abstract = {A lineage of 12 arid land shrubby species in the gymnosperm genus Ephedra (Gnetales) from North America is used to evaluate the influence of climate on speciation. With a long evolutionary history, and a well documented fossil record this lineage is an ideal model for understanding the process of speciation under a niche conservatism scenario. Using seven DNA molecular markers, Bayesian inference is carried out to uncover sister species and to estimate time of divergence of the lineages. Ecological niche models are generated for four parapatric and sympatric sister species and two analyses of niche evolution are performed, one based on ecological niche models and another using raw data and multivariate analysis. As previous analyses suggest, the diversification of North America Ephedra species may be the result of a recent secondary radiation. Both parapatric and sympatric species diverged mostly in a scenario of climatic niche conservatism. However, we also found strong evidence for niche divergence for one of the sister species pairs (E. californica-E. trifurca). Moreover, the multivariate analysis found environmental differences for some variables between sister species. The estimated divergence time of three pairs of sister species distributed in southwestern North America (E. cutleri-E. aspera, E. californica-E. trifurca and E. torreyana-E. viridis) is inferred to have occurred in the Late Miocene to Pliocene and for the sister species pair E. antisyphilitica-E. coryi distributed in the southern United States and northeastern Mexico, it was inferred from the Pliocene to Pleistocene. The orogenetic and climatic changes documented for these regions related to expansion of arid lands, may have contributed to the diversification in North American Ephedra, rather than adaptations to new climatic conditions.},

Phylogenetic analyses of the DNA data indicate that relationships within the genus are better predicted by geographic region of origin than by ovulate cone characters. The sampled species with dry, winged (versus fleshy) ovulate cone bracts or single-seeded cones do not form monophyletic groups and therefore the previous classification systems of Ephedra based on these aspects of bract morphology appear to be largely unnatural. Three groups were identified among the Old World species studied, one comprising European and Mediterranean species and two including only Asian species. The sequence data suggest a possible early divergence of a New World clade of Ephedra from among the Old World groups. The South American species form a distinct clade apparently related to one of two groups of North American species, which accords with a frequent floristic pattern of close relationships between species groups in western South America and southwestern North America.},

Plastid trnL-trnF and nuclear ITS sequence data were analyzed using parsimony and Bayesian methods and molecular evolutionary rates calibrated using the Oligocene fossil record of Elaeocarpus mesocarps to estimate the minimum divergence dates. The results indicate the monophyly of all recognized genera and a placement for the former Tremandraceae (three genera and about 49 species of shrubby, dry-adapted Australian plants) within the widespread predominantly rainforest tree family Elaeocarpaceae (nine genera, over 500 species). The former Tremandraceae clade diverged from its sister (Aceratium + Elaeocarpus + Sericolea) during the Paleocene, after which it underwent a marked acceleration in evolutionary rate. Furthermore, this lineage diversified during the late Miocene, coincident with widespread aridification in Australian environments and extensive radiations of several sclerophyllous groups. The role of dispersal in explaining the current geographical distribution of Elaeocarpaceae is illustrated by Aristotelia. This genus, whose distribution was previously thought to reflect Gondwanan vicariance, is shown to have arrived in New Zealand from Australia at least 6-7 million yr ago.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Radiation in some plant groups has occurred on islands and due to the characteristic rapid pace of phenotypic evolution, standard molecular markers often provide insufficient variation for phylogenetic reconstruction. To resolve relationships within a clade of 21 closely related New Caledonian Diospyros species and evaluate species boundaries we analysed genome-wide DNA variation via amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). RESULTS A neighbour-joining (NJ) dendrogram based on Dice distances shows all species except D. minimifolia, D. parviflora and D. vieillardii to form unique clusters of genetically similar accessions. However, there was little variation between these species clusters, resulting in unresolved species relationships and a star-like general NJ topology. Correspondingly, analyses of molecular variance showed more variation within species than between them. A Bayesian analysis with BEAST produced a similar result. Another Bayesian method, this time a clustering method, Structure, demonstrated the presence of two groups, highly congruent with those observed in a principal coordinate analysis (PCO). Molecular divergence between the two groups is low and does not correspond to any hypothesised taxonomic, ecological or geographical patterns. CONCLUSIONS We hypothesise that such a pattern could have been produced by rapid and complex evolution involving a widespread progenitor for which an initial split into two groups was followed by subsequent fragmentation into many diverging populations, which was followed by range expansion of then divergent entities. Overall, this process resulted in an opportunistic pattern of phenotypic diversification. The time since divergence was probably insufficient for some species to become genetically well-differentiated, resulting in progenitor/derivative relationships being exhibited in a few cases. In other cases, our analyses may have revealed evidence for the existence of cryptic species, for which more study of morphology and ecology are now required.},

New Caledonian Diospyros species fall into three clades, two of which have only a few members (1 or 5 species); the third has 21 closely related species for which relationships among species have been mostly unresolved in a previous study. Although species of the third group (NC clade III) are morphologically distinct and largely occupy different habitats, they exhibit little molecular variability. Diospyros vieillardii is sister to the rest of the NC clade III, followed by D. umbrosa and D. flavocarpa, which are sister to the rest of this clade. Species from coastal habitats of western Grande Terre (D. cherrieri and D. veillonii) and some found on coralline substrates (D. calciphila and D. inexplorata) form two well-supported subgroups. The species of NC clade III have significantly larger genomes than found in diploid species of Diospyros from other parts of the world, but they all appear to be diploids. By applying a molecular clock, we infer that the ancestor of the NC clade III arrived in New Caledonia around 9 million years ago. The oldest species are around 7 million years old and the youngest ones probably much less than 1 million years.},

	abstract = {Due to its special geological history, the New Caledonian Archipelago is a mosaic of soil types, and in combination with climatic conditions this results in a heterogeneous environment across relatively small distances. A group of over 20 endemic species of Diospyros (Ebenaceae) has rapidly and recently radiated on the archipelago after a single long-distance dispersal event. Most of the Diospyros species in the radiating group are morphologically and ecologically well differentiated, but they exhibit low levels of DNA variability. To investigate the processes that shaped the diversification of this group we employed restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). Over 8400 filtered SNPs generally confirm species delimitations and produce a well-supported phylogenetic tree. Our analyses document local introgression, but only a limited potential for gene flow over longer distances. The phylogenetic relationships point to an early regional clustering among populations and species, indicating that allopatric speciation with respect to macrohabitat (i.e., climatic conditions) may have had a role in the initial differentiation within the group. A later, more rapid radiation involved divergence with respect to microhabitat (i.e., soil preference). Several sister species in the group show a parallel divergence in edaphic preference. Searches for genomic regions that are systematically differentiated in this replicated phenotypic divergence pointed to loci potentially involved in ion binding and cellular transport. These loci appear meaningful in the context of adaptations to soil types that differ in heavy-metal and mineral content. Identical nucleotide changes affected only two of these loci, indicating that introgression may have played a limited role in their evolution. Our results suggest that both allopatric diversification and (parapatric) ecological divergence shaped successive rounds of speciation in the Diospyros radiation on New Caledonia.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-12-180},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND The fern genus Dryopteris (Dryopteridaceae) is among the most common and species rich fern genera in temperate forests in the northern hemisphere containing 225-300 species worldwide. The circumscription of Dryopteris has been controversial and various related genera have, over the time, been included in and excluded from Dryopteris. The infrageneric phylogeny has largely remained unclear, and the placement of the majority of the supraspecific taxa of Dryopteris has never been tested using molecular data. RESULTS In this study, DNA sequences of four plastid loci (rbcL gene, rps4-trnS spacer, trnL intron, trnL-F spacer) were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of Dryopteris. A total of 122 accessions are sampled in our analysis and they represent 100 species of the expanded Dryopteris including Acrophorus, Acrorumohra, Diacalpe, Dryopsis, Nothoperanema, and Peranema. All four subgenera and 19 sections currently recognized in Dryopteris s.s. are included. One species each of Arachniodes, Leptorumohra, and Lithostegia of Dryopteridaceae are used as outgroups. Our study confirms the paraphyly of Dryopteris and provides the first strong molecular evidence on the monophyly of Acrophorus, Diacalpe, Dryopsis, Nothoperanema, and Peranema. However, all these monophyletic groups together with the paraphyletic Acrorumohra are suggested to be merged into Dryopteris based on both molecular and morphological evidence. Our analysis identified 13 well-supported monophyletic groups. Each of the 13 clades is additionally supported by morphological synapomophies and is inferred to represent a major evolutionary lineage in Dryopteris. In contrast, monophyly of the four subgenera and 15 out of 19 sections currently recognized in Dryopteris s.s is not supported by plastid data. CONCLUSIONS The genera, Acrophorus, Acrorumohra, Diacalpe, Dryopsis, Nothoperanema, and Peranema, should all be merged into Dryopteris. Most species of these genera share a short rhizome and catadromic arrangement of frond segments, unlike the sister genus of Dryopteris s.l., Arachniodes, which has anadromic arrangement of frond segments. The non-monophyly of the 19 out of the 21 supraspecific taxa (sections, subgenera) in Dryopteris strongly suggests that the current taxonomy of this genus is in need of revision. The disagreement between the previous taxonomy and molecular results in Dryopteris may be due partly to interspecific hybridization and polyplodization. More morphological studies and molecular data, especially from the nuclear genome, are needed to thoroughly elucidate the evolutionary history of Dryopteris. The 13 well-supported clades identified based on our data represent 13 major evolutionary lineages in Dryopteris that are also supported by morphological synapomophies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The thirteen species of Dryopteris in North America have long been suspected of having undergone a complicated history of reticulate evolution via allopolyploid hybridization. Various explanations for the origins of the allopolyploid taxa have been suggested, and though most lines of evidence have supported the so-called "semicristata" hypothesis, contention over the group's history has continued in several recent, conflicting studies. RESULTS Sequence data from nine plastid and two nuclear markers were collected from 73 accessions representing 35 species of Dryopteris. Sequences from each of the allopolyploids are most closely related to their progenitor species as predicted by the "semicristata" hypothesis. Allotetraploid D. campyloptera appears to be derived from a hybrid between diploid D. expansa and D. intermedia; D. celsa, from diploid D. ludoviciana x D. goldiana; and D. carthusiana and D. cristata, from diploid "D. semicristata" x D. intermedia and D. ludoviciana, respectively. Allohexaploid D. clintoniana appears to be derived from D. cristata x D.goldiana. The earliest estimated dates of formation of the allopolyploids, based on divergence time analyses, were within the last 6 Ma. We found no evidence for recurrent formation of any of the allopolyploids. The sexual allopolyploid taxa are derived from crosses between parents that show intermediate levels of genetic divergence relative to all pairs of potential progenitors. In addition, the four allotetraploids are transgressive with respect to geographic range relative to one or both of their parents (their ranges extend beyond those of the parents), suggesting that ecological advantages in novel habitats or regions may promote long-term regional coexistence of the hybrid taxa with their progenitors. CONCLUSIONS This study provides the first thorough evaluation of the North American complex of woodferns using extensive sampling of taxa and genetic markers. Phylogenies produced from each of three datasets (one plastid and two nuclear) support the "semicristata" hypothesis, including the existence of a missing diploid progenitor, and allow us to reject all competing hypotheses. This study demonstrates the value of using multiple, biparentally inherited markers to evaluate reticulate complexes, assess the frequency of recurrent polyploidization, and determine the relative importance of introgression vs. hybridization in shaping the histories of such groups.},

	abstract = {Reticulate, or non-bifurcating, evolution is now recognized as an important phenomenon shaping the histories of many organisms. It appears to be particularly common in plants, especially in ferns, which have relatively few barriers to intra- and interspecific hybridization. Reticulate evolutionary patterns have been recognized in many fern groups, though very few have been studied rigorously using modern molecular phylogenetic techniques in order to determine the causes of the reticulate patterns. In the current study, we examine patterns of branching and reticulate evolution in the genus Dryopteris, the woodferns. The North American members of this group have long been recognized as a classic example of reticulate evolution in plants, and we extend analysis of the genus to all 30 species in the New World, as well as numerous taxa from other regions. We employ sequence data from the plastid and nuclear genomes and use maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), Bayesian inference (BI), and divergence time analyses to explore the relationships of New World Dryopteris to other regions and to reconstruct the timing and events which may have led to taxa displaying reticulate rather than strictly branching histories. We find evidence for reticulation among both the North and Central/South American groups of species, and our data support a classic hypothesis for reticulate evolution via allopolyploid speciation in the North America taxa, including an extinct diploid progenitor in this group. In the Central and South American species, we find evidence of extensive reticulation involving unknown ancestors from Asia, and we reject deep coalescent processes such as incomplete lineage sorting in favor of more recent intercontinental hybridization and chloroplast capture as an explanation for the origin of the Latin American reticulate taxa.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Dryopteris is a large, cosmopolitan fern genus ideal for addressing questions about diversification, biogeography, hybridization, and polyploidy, which have historically been understudied in ferns. We constructed a highly resolved, well-supported phylogeny for New World Dryopteris and used it to investigate biogeographic patterns and divergence times. METHODS We analyzed relationships among 97 species of Dryopteris, including taxa from all major biogeographic regions, with analyses based on 5699 aligned nucleotides from seven plastid loci. Phylogenetic analyses used maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. We conducted divergence time analyses using BEAST and biogeographic analyses using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and S-DIVA approaches. We explored the monophyly of subgenera and sections in the most recent generic classification and of geographic groups of taxa using Templeton tests. KEY RESULTS The genus Dryopteris arose ca. 42 million years ago (Ma). Most of the Central and South American species form a well-supported clade which arose 32 Ma, but the remaining New World species are the result of multiple, independent dispersal and vicariance events involving Asia, Europe, and Africa over the last 15 Myr. We identified six long-distance dispersal events and three vicariance events in the immediate ancestry of New World species; reconstructions for another four lineages were ambiguous. CONCLUSIONS New World Dryopteris are not monophyletic; vicariance has dominated the history of the North American species, while long-distance dispersal prevails in the Central and South American species, a pattern not previously seen in plants.},

	abstract = {We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the fern genus Elaphoglossum using two non-coding chloroplast spacers: trnL-trnF and rps4-trnS. The sampling includes 123 species, of which 80 have not been previously sequenced, and for the first time includes species from Africa and the Indian Ocean area. The results of this expanded study largely agree with an earlier molecular study based on a smaller group of neotropical species and with the morphology-based classification of Mickel and Atehortua. We found, however, that some infrageneric groups such as section Elaphoglossum are not monophyletic. Besides section Elaphoglossum pro parte, we recognize six sections: two new monospecific, unnamed sections, and the previously established sections Lepidoglossa, Squamipedia, Amygdalifolia, and "Subulate-scaled clade." We divide the subulate-scaled clade into subsection Setosa (hydathodes present) and Polytrichia (hydathodes absent), and section Elaphoglossum is divided into subsections Platyglossa and Pachyglossa, two groups that do not appear to be supported by any single morphological character. In general, however, the main clades are supported by morphology. Finally, we discuss the species of the Indian Ocean region and their affinities with the neotropical ones. Out of the 11 species pairs postulated by Moran and Smith on the basis of morphology, two are well supported (E. eximium-E. aubertii; E. piloselloides-E. spatulatum) and three are not supported (E. ciliatum-E. humbertii; E. muscosum-E. poolii; E. paleaceum-E. deckenii), and two remain unresolved (E. erinaceum-E. hybridum; E. glabellum-E. acrostichoides) because our molecular markers were not variable enough. Four species pairs could not be tested because specimens were lacking. Unsupported species pairs are best interpreted as morphological convergences. Two additional species pairs are proposed: E. cuspidatum-E. succisaefolium; E. doanense-E. hornei. Placement of the species from the Indian Ocean suggests that at least 13 long-distance dispersal events occurred between the Neotropics and the Indian Ocean-Africa.},

Recent biogeographic inquiries have established patterns of Andean divergence, but investigations on ferns are scant. The fern genus Polystichum Roth (Dryopteridaceae) combines widespread geographic and elevational distribution with a large number of species to form an ideal system for investigation of the origin and diversification patterns of a fern lineage in the tropical Andes. METHODS The relationships among 42 Polystichum species, including taxa from all major biogeographic regions, were analyzed with 2591 aligned nucleotides from four plastid markers using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. The resulting phylogeny was then used to estimate divergence times and reconstruct both ancestral areas and ancestral elevations. KEY RESULTS Tropical Andean South American polystichums that lack an indusium (sori exindusiate) were confirmed to form a monophyletic group. This exindusiate Andean Polystichum clade diverged from a middle-elevation forest lineage now rich in species endemic to Mexico during the middle Miocene (13.12 million years ago). The majority of diversification that followed took place in the montane regions of the central Andes with radiations to the northern Andes, southeastern Brazil, and alpine regions. CONCLUSIONS The monophyletic exindusiate Andean Polystichum lineage diverged from a Mexican lineage in the middle Miocene and diversified in the central Andes before dispersing northward. This south-to-north dispersal pattern, documented for many other Andean lineages, corresponds with episodes of uplift in the tropical Andes.},

	abstract = {Cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase (pgiC) is an enzyme essential to glycolysis found universally in eukaryotes, but broad understanding of variation in the gene coding for pgiC is lacking for ferns. We used a substantially expanded representation of the gene for Andean species of the fern genus Polystichum to characterize pgiC in ferns relative to angiosperms, insects, and an amoebozoan; assess the impact of selection versus neutral evolutionary processes on pgiC; and explore evolutionary relationships of selected Andean species. The dataset of complete sequences comprised nine accessions representing seven species and one hybrid from the Andes and Serra do Mar. The aligned sequences of the full data set comprised 3376 base pairs (70\% of the entire gene) including 17 exons and 15 introns from two central areas of the gene. The exons are highly conserved relative to angiosperms and retain substantial homology to insect pgiC, but intron length and structure are unique to the ferns. Average intron size is similar to angiosperms; intron number and location in insects are unlike those of the plants we considered. The introns included an array of indels and, in intron 7, an extensive microsatellite array with potential utility in analyzing population-level histories. Bayesian and maximum-parsimony analysis of 129 variable nucleotides in the Andean polystichums revealed that 59 (1.7\% of the 3376 total) were phylogenetically informative; most of these united sister accessions. The phylogenetic trees for the Andean polystichums were incongruent with previously published cpDNA trees for the same taxa, likely the result of rapid evolutionary change in the introns and contrasting stability in the exons. The exons code a total of seven amino-acid substitutions. Comparison of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions did not suggest that the pgiC gene is under selection in the Andes. Variation in pgiC including two additional accessions represented by incomplete sequences provided new insights into reticulate relationships among Andean taxa.},

The cosmopolitan family Dryopteridaceae represents one of the most species-rich families of leptosporangiate ferns, yet its fossil record is sparse and poorly understood. Here, we describe a fern inclusion in Miocene Dominican amber and investigate its relationships to extant Dryopteridaceae.• METHODS The morphology of the fossil was compared with descriptions of extant ferns, resulting in it being tentatively assigned to the bolbitidoid fern genus Elaphoglossum. This assignment was confirmed by reconstructing the evolution of the morphological characters preserved in the inclusion on a molecular phylogeny of 158 extant bolbitidoid ferns. To assess the morphology-based assignment of the fossil to Elaphoglossum, we examined DNA-calibrated divergence time estimates against the age of the amber deposits from which it came.• KEY RESULTS The fossil belongs to Elaphoglossum and is the first of a bolbitidoid fern. Its assignment to a particular section of Elaphoglossum could not be determined; however, sects. Lepidoglossa, Polytrichia, and Setosa can be discounted because the fossil lacks subulate scales or scales with acicular marginal hairs. Thus, the fossil might belong to either sects. Amygdalifolia, Wrightiana, Elaphoglossum, or Squamipedia or to an extinct lineage.• CONCLUSIONS The discovery of a Miocene Elaphoglossum fossil provides remarkable support to current molecular clock-based estimates of the diversification of these ferns.},

The phylogenetic patterns strongly suggest the polyphyletic status of Dryopteris; the monophyletic groupings of the species do not correspond with either Fraser-Jenkins [In: Bull Brit Mus (Nat Hist) Bot 14(3):183-218, 1986\vphantom{\{}\} or Wu (In: Flora Reipublica Popularis Sinicae Tomus 5 (1) pp 1-241, 2000] subgeneric classification of Dryopteris, except in a few specific cases. This work represents the first molecular systematic analyses of Chinese Dryopteris, and we propose the next steps necessary to recognize new subgenera of the genus.},

	abstract = {• Premise of the study: As currently circumscribed, Lastreopsis has about 45 species and occurs in Australia, southern Asia, Africa, Madagascar, and the neotropics. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies suggested that Lastreopsis is paraphyletic. Our study focuses on resolving relationships among the lastreopsid ferns (Lastreopsis, Megalastrum, and Rumohra), the evolution of morphological characters, and an understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns that have led to the current diversity and geographical distribution of its extant species.• Methods: Phylogenetic relationships were recovered under Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony methods, using a data set of four plastid markers. Divergence time estimates were made using BEAST, and the biogeographic hypotheses were tested under the DEC model and the RASP/S-DIVA methods.• Key results: Lastreopsis was recovered as paraphyletic, and at least one of its clades should be recognized as a distinct genus, Parapolystichum. Coveniella poecilophlebia and Oenotrichia tripinnata were nested within Lastreopsis s.s., Megalastrum and Rumohra as sister to the Lastreopsis s.s., and the Lastreopsis amplissima clades. The initial diversification of the lastreopsids took place at about 56.55 Ma, from a neotropical ancestor.• Conclusions: Taxonomic recognition of Parapolystichum is warranted to preserve the monophyly of Lastreopsis. Diversification among the main clades of the lastreopsid ferns was influenced by climatic and geological changes in the southern hemisphere. The biogeographic history of the group is intimately related to the trans-Antarctic corridor between Australia and South America, with evidence for multiple lineage interchanges between Australia and South America during the Oligocene and the Eocene epochs.},

	abstract = {The diverse and pantropical genus Ctenitis, in the Dryopteridaceae, has been largely ignored in phylogenetic studies until now. In this study, we fill in this gap by reconstructing the first comprehensive phylogeny of the genus including 53 species currently recognized in the genus Ctenitis, among which seven species formerly were assigned to the genus Pseudotectaria and one to Heterogonium. Special emphasis was given to the sampling of species occurring in the African-Indian Ocean region. The presented results include reconstruction of a biogeographic scenario based on estimated divergence times and ancestral area reconstruction. Our findings confirm the inclusion, within Ctenitis, of the Indian Ocean species formerly placed in Pseudotectaria and Heterogonium. The crown group divergence was estimated to date back to the Oligocene or Early Miocene. The biogeographical scenario indicates an initial divergence of the Asian-Pacific ranges and the neotropical ranges, and a subsequent colonization of the Afro-Madagascan region by a lineage with neotropical ancestors. The Afro-Madagascan lineage splits into a lineage endemic to the Mascarene islands and a lineage occurring in Madagascar, the Comoros and Africa. The range expansion towards Africa and Madagascar was estimated to date back to the late Miocene, whereas the estimated ages for the onset of the diversification of the Mascarene diversity is consistent with the ages of these young, volcanic islands. The absence of any extant species of Ctenitis with a multi-continental distribution range and the rarity of inter-island dispersal and speciation in the Indian Ocean region suggest a limited contribution of long distance dispersal to the biogeographical history of this fern genus, versus a high contribution of local speciation.},

	abstract = {The fern genus Dryopteris (Dryopteridaceae) is represented in the Hawaiian Islands by 18 endemic taxa and one non-endemic, native species. The goals of this study were to determine whether Dryopteris in Hawai'i is monophyletic and to infer the biogeographical origins of Hawaiian Dryopteris by determining the geographical distributions of their closest living relatives. We sequenced two chloroplast DNA fragments, rbcL and the trnL-F intergenic spacer (IGS), for 18 Hawaiian taxa, 45 non-Hawaiian taxa, and two outgroup species. For individual fragments, we estimated phylogenetic relationships using Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony. We performed a combined analysis of both cpDNA fragments employing Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood. These analyses indicate that Hawaiian Dryopteris is not monophyletic, and that there were at least five separate colonizations of the Hawaiian Islands by different species of dryopteroid ferns, with most of the five groups having closest relatives in SE Asia. The results suggest that one colonizing ancestor, perhaps from SE Asia, gave rise to eight endemic taxa (the glabra group). Another colonizing ancestor, also possibly from SE Asia, gave rise to a group of five endemic taxa (the exindusiate group). Dryopteris fusco-atra and its two varieties, which are endemic to Hawai'i, most likely diversified from a SE Asian ancestor. The Hawaiian endemic Nothoperanema rubiginosum has its closest relatives in SE Asia, and while the remaining two species, D. wallichiana and D. subbipinnata, are sister species, their biogeographical origins could not be determined from these analyses due to the widespread distributions of D. wallichiana and its closest non-Hawaiian relative.},

In addition to confused intrageneric classification of Drosera, the intergeneric relationships among the Drosera and two other genera in the Droseraceae with snap traps, Dionaea and Aldrovanda, are problematic. We conducted phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences of the chloroplast rbcL gene for 59 species of Drosera, covering all sections except one. These analyses revealed that five of 11 sections, including three monotypic sections, are polyphyletic. Combined rbcL and 18S rDNA sequence data were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among Drosera, Dionaea, and Aldrovanda. This analysis revealed that all Drosera species form a clade sister to a clade including Dionaea and Aldrovanda, suggesting that the snap traps of Aldrovanda and Dionaea are homologous despite their morphological differences. MacClade reconstructions indicated that multiple episodes of aneuploidy occurred in a clade that includes mainly Australian species, while the chromosome numbers in the other clades are not as variable. Drosera regia, which is native to South Africa, and most species native to Australia, were clustered basally, suggesting that Drosera originated in Africa or Australia. The rbcL tree indicates that Australian species expanded their distribution to South America and then to Africa. Expansion of distribution to the Northern Hemisphere from the Southern Hemispere occurred in a few different lineages.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS In the Mascarenes, a young oceanic archipelago composed of three main islands, the Dombeyoideae (Malvaceae) have diversified extensively with a high endemism rate. With the exception of the genus Trochetia, Mascarene Dombeyoideae are described as dioecious whereas Malagasy and African species are considered to be monocline, species with individuals bearing hermaphrodite/perfect flowers. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed to clarify the taxonomy, understand the phylogeographic pattern of relationships and infer the evolution of the breeding systems for the Mascarenes Dombeyoideae. METHODS Parsimony and Bayesian analysis of four DNA markers (ITS, rpl16 intron and two intergenic spacers trnQ-rsp16 and psbM-trnD) was used. The molecular matrix comprised 2985 characters and 48 taxa. The Bayesian phylogeny was used to infer phylogeographical hypotheses and the evolution of breeding systems. KEY RESULTS Parsimony and Bayesian trees produced similar results. The Dombeyoideae from the Mascarenes are polyphyletic and distributed among four clades. Species of Dombeya, Trochetia and Ruizia are nested in the same clade, which implies the paraphyly of Dombeya. Additionally, it is shown that each of the four clades has an independent Malagasy origin. Two adaptive radiation events have occurred within two endemic lineages of the Mascarenes. The polyphyly of the Mascarene Dombeyoideae suggests at least three independent acquisitions of dioecy. CONCLUSIONS This molecular phylogeny highlights the taxonomic issues within the Dombeyoideae. Indeed, the limits and distinctions of the genera Dombeya, Trochetia and Ruizia should be reconsidered. The close phylogeographic relationships between the flora of the Mascarenes and Madagascar are confirmed. Despite their independent origins and a distinct evolutionary history, each endemic clade has developed a different breeding systems (dioecy) compared with the Malagasy Dombeyoideae. Sex separation appears as an evolutionary convergence and may be the consequence of selective pressures particular to insular environments.},

We determined partial sequences of the PgiC gene from species of Shorea, Hopea, Neobalanocarpus, and Parashorea to elucidate phylogenetic relationships among the species of these genera, which have been regarded as interrelated. The sequences generated a gene tree with better resolution than previous cpDNA trees. The PgiC tree is essentially consistent with cpDNA trees, except for the placement of Neobalanocarpus. The PgiC tree shows that Neobalanocarpus is nested within White Meranti of Shorea, whereas this genus forms a clade with Hopea in cpDNA trees. This conflict suggests that Neobalanocarpus is derived via hybridization between White Meranti of Shorea and Hopea. Species belonging to each of three timber groups (Yellow Meranti, Balau, and Red Meranti) within Shorea are monophyletic. Together they form a monophyletic clade distinct from White Meranti. Botanical sections within Red Meranti appear not to be monophyletic. An extensive number of shared polymorphisms among species and consequential lack of monophyly of intraspecific haplotypes are found in Red Meranti. Potential causes of this phenomenon, including persistence of ancestral polymorphisms and gene flow via interspecific hybridization, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The genus Knautia (Caprifoliaceae, Dipsacoideae) encompasses 40-60 species mainly distributed in western Eurasia, with highest species diversity in the Alps and the Balkan Peninsula. It is traditionally regarded as one of the taxonomically most challenging European genera due to the widespread occurrence of polyploidy, the high incidence of hybridisation and the maintenance of morphologically intermediate forms. A prerequisite for assessing the complex spatiotemporal diversification of a polyploid group is a comprehensive hypothesis of the phylogenetic relationships among its diploid members. To this end, DNA sequence data (nrDNA ITS and plastid petN(ycf6)-psbM) combined with AFLP fingerprinting were performed on 148 diploid populations belonging to 35 taxa. Phylogenies obtained by maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses were used to test the monophyly of the genus and its three sections Trichera, Tricheroides and Knautia, to provide insights into its evolutionary history and to test previous hypotheses of inter- and intrasectional classification. Both nuclear and chloroplast datasets support the monophyly of Knautia and its three sections, with ambiguous placement of K. cf. degenii. The majority of species belong to the nearly exclusively perennial section Trichera (x=10). Within section Trichera all markers revealed largely unresolved phylogenetic relationships suggesting rapid radiation and recent range expansion. In addition, extensive sharing of plastid haplotypes across taxa and wide geographic ranges of plastid haplotypes and ribotype groups were observed. The molecular data are partly at odds with the traditional informal grouping of taxa within section Trichera. Whereas the traditional groups of K. dinarica, K. drymeia and K. montana can be maintained, the new, smaller and well supported Midzorensis and Pancicii Groups as well as the SW European Group are separated from the heterogeneous traditional K. longifolia group. The former groups of K. arvensis, K. dalmatica, K. fleischmannii and K. velutina are clearly polyphyletic. Their diploid members have to be rearranged into the Xerophytic Group, the Carinthiaca Group, and the Northern and Southern Arvensis Groups. The annual sections Tricheroides (x=10) and Knautia (x=8) with only a few taxa are resolved in the ITS and plastid trees on long branches as early diverging lineages within the genus.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Polyploidisation is one of the most important mechanisms in the evolution of angiosperms. As in many other genera, formation of polyploids has significantly contributed to diversification and radiation of Knautia (Caprifoliaceae, Dipsacoideae). Comprehensive studies of fine- and broad-scale patterns of ploidy and genome size (GS) variation are, however, still limited to relatively few genera and little is known about the geographic distribution of ploidy levels within these genera. Here, we explore ploidy and GS variation in Knautia based on a near-complete taxonomic and comprehensive geographic sampling. RESULTS Genome size is a reliable indicator of ploidy level in Knautia, even if monoploid genome downsizing is observed in the polyploid cytotypes. Twenty-four species studied are diploid, 16 tetraploid and two hexaploid, whereas ten species possess two, and two species possess three ploidy levels. Di- and tetraploids are distributed across most of the distribution area of Knautia, while hexaploids were sampled in the Balkan and Iberian Peninsulas and the Alps. CONCLUSIONS We show that the frequency of polyploidisation is unevenly distributed in Knautia both in a geographic and phylogenetic context. Monoploid GS varies considerably among three evolutionary lineages (sections) of Knautia, but also within sections Trichera and Tricheroides, as well as within some of the species. Although the exact causes of this variation remain elusive, we demonstrate that monoploid GS increases significantly towards the limits of the genus' distribution.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-11-325},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like genes have been implicated in the development of capitulum inflorescences (i.e. flowering heads) in Asteraceae, where many small flowers (florets) are packed tightly into an inflorescence that resembles a single flower. Several rounds of duplication of CYC-like genes have occurred in Asteraceae, and this is hypothesized to be correlated with the evolution of the capitulum, which in turn has been implicated in the evolutionary success of the group. We investigated the evolution of CYC-like genes in Dipsacaceae (Dipsacales), a plant clade in which capitulum inflorescences originated independently of Asteraceae. Two main inflorescence types are present in Dipsacaceae: (1) radiate species contain two kinds of floret within the flowering head (disk and ray), and (2) discoid species contain only disk florets. To test whether a dynamic pattern of gene duplication, similar to that documented in Asteraceae, is present in Dipsacaceae, and whether these patterns are correlated with different inflorescence types, we inferred a CYC-like gene phylogeny for Dipsacaceae based on representative species from the major lineages. RESULTS We recovered within Dipsacaceae the three major forms of CYC-like genes that have been found in most core eudicots, and identified several additional duplications within each of these clades. We found that the number of CYC-like genes in Dipsacaceae is similar to that reported for members of Asteraceae and that the same gene lineages (CYC1-like and CYC2B-like genes) have duplicated in a similar fashion independently in both groups. The number of CYC-like genes recovered for radiate versus discoid species differed, with discoid species having fewer copies of CYC1-like and CYC2B-like genes. CONCLUSIONS CYC-like genes have undergone extensive duplication in Dipsacaceae, with radiate species having more copies than discoid species, suggesting a potential role for these genes in the evolution of disk and ray florets. The similarity in CYC-like gene diversification seen in Dipsacaceae and some members of the Asteraceae sets the stage to investigate whether the convergent evolution of capitulum inflorescences in both groups may have been underlain by convergent evolution in the same gene family.},

	abstract = {Recent phylogenetic analyses based on single gene and combined data sets have substantially increased our knowledge of the phylogeny of Caryophyllales s.l., indicating that additional carnivorous families are related to this alliance. In earlier contributions towards a reassessment of inter- and infrafamilial relationships slowly evolving genes had been preferred for phylogenetic inference. The resulting tree topologies based on rbcL and 18S rDNA, however, were characterized by limited resolution, low internal support and topological incongruence. Therefore genomic regions evolving more rapidly have been used in subsequent studies. Comparative sequencing of the matK gene and the flanking trnK intron region as well as combined analyses based on plastid matK, atpB, rbcL, and nuclear 18S rDNA have effectively improved resolution and internal support. Tree topologies revealed Caryophyllales s.l. as monophyletic group and indicated a clear division into two sister clades, the "core" and the "non-core" Caryophyllales (with Rhabdodendraceae and Simmondsiaceae with unclear affinities). Contrary to the "core" group (with Asteropeiaceae and Physenaceae as successive sister groups), which corresponds largely to the previous circumscription of the order, the monophyly of "non-core" Caryophyllales comprising Polygonaceae, Plumbaginaceae, Frankeniaceae, and Tamaricaceae along with the carnivorous families Droseraceae, Nepenthaceae, Drosophyllaceae, Dioncophyllaceae, and Ancistrocladaceae are a recent discovery. Based on reliable tree topologies it is hypothesized that pitfall traps of Nepenthes and snap traps typical for Aldrovanda and Dionaea were derived from a common ancestor with adhesive flypaper traps. With exception of Triphyophyllum carnivory was secondarily lost in the remaining Dioncophyllaceae (Dioncophyllum, Habropetalum) and all taxa of Ancistrocladaceae.},

Further, the relationships of species within Carpha have been unclear. In this study, cladistic analyses based on chloroplast trnL intron and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer sequence data were undertaken to estimate phylogenetic relationships in and around Carpha. This study found that Trianoptiles is sister to Carpha; Ptilothrix is sister to Cyathochaeta rather than to Carpha as suggested by some former authors; and Gymnoschoenus is distant from Carpha and its close relatives. The merging of Schoenoides back into Oreobolus is supported. The findings also revealed the non-monophyletic status of Costularia and of Schoenus, and indicated the phylogenetic relationships of species within Carpha.},

	abstract = {ITS sequence data were used to estimate the phylogeny of 24 Japanese Eleocharis species and to make karyomorphological observations on 19 of these taxa. Two major clades were identified in Japanese Eleocharis molecular phylogenetic trees: (1) one including all species of section Limnochloa, and (2) another comprising two sections, Pauciflorae and Eleocharis. Phylogenetic analysis including both Japanese and North American species also shows strong support for monophyly of the Mutatae/ Limnochloa clade. The width of the spikelets in the species Mutatae/ Limnochloa is the same as that of the culms, indicating that the relative widths of spikelets and culms are useful characteristics for classification. Two major clades were supported by karyomorphological data. All taxa of section Limnochloa had very small chromosomes, while sections Pauciflorae and Eleocharis had large chromosomes. The basic chromosome number of sections Eleocharis and Pauciflorae is thought to be x=5. Chromosomal evolution in the genus Eleocharis with diffuse centromeric chromosomes may be caused by both aneuploidization and polyploidization. Our data suggest that a 3-bp insertion near the 3' end of the 5.8S gene is useful for intrageneric delimitations of the genus Eleocharis.},

Low chromosome numbers, 2n = 12 or 24, with large sizes were observed in these three sections. Our results suggest that the genus Carex might have originated or relictly restricted in the East Asia. Geographical distributions of diploid species are restricted in narrower areas, while those of tetraploid species are wider in East Asia. It is concluded that chromosomal variations in Siderostictae clade may have been caused by polyploidization and that tetraploid species may have been able to exploit their habitats by polyploidization.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The broad austral distribution of Schoeneae is almost certainly a product of long-distance dispersal. Owing to the inadequacies of existing phylogenetic data and a lack of rigorous biogeographic analysis, relationships within the tribe remain poorly resolved and its pattern of radiation and dispersal uncertain. We employed an expanded sampling of taxa and markers and a rigorous analytic approach to address these limitations. We evaluated the roles of geography and ecology in stimulating the initial radiation of the group and its subsequent dispersal across the southern hemisphere. METHODS A dated tree was reconstructed using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with a polytomy prior and molecular dating, applied to data from two nuclear and three cpDNA regions. Ancestral areas and habitats were inferred using dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis models. KEY RESULTS Schoeneae originated in Australia in the Paleocene. The existence of a "hard" polytomy at the base of the clade reflects the rapid divergence of six principal lineages ca. 50 Ma, within Australia. From this ancestral area, Schoeneae have traversed the austral oceans with remarkable frequency, a total of 29 distinct dispersal events being reported here. Dispersal rates between landmasses are not explicable in terms of the geographical distances separating them. Transoceanic dispersal generally involved habitat stasis. CONCLUSIONS Although the role of dispersal in explaining global distribution patterns is now widely accepted, the apparent ease with which such dispersal may occur has perhaps been under-appreciated. In Schoeneae, transoceanic dispersal has been remarkably frequent, with ecological opportunity, rather than geography, being most important in dictating dispersal patterns.},

As a result, generic relationships are poorly understood, and even the monophyly of the tribe is open to question. In this study, plastid DNA sequences (rbcL, trnL-trnF, and rps16) drawn from a broad array of Schoeneae are analysed using Bayesian and parsimony-based approaches to infer a framework phylogeny for the tribe. Both analytical methods broadly support the monophyly of Schoeneae, Bayesian methods doing so with good support. Within the schoenoid clade, there is strong support for a series of monophyletic generic groupings whose interrelationships are unclear. These lineages form a large polytomy at the base of Schoeneae that may be indicative of past radiation, probably following the fragmentation of Gondwana. Most of these lineages contain both African and non-African members, suggesting a history of intercontinental dispersal. The results of this study clearly identify the relationships of the African-endemic schoenoid genera and demonstrate that the African-Australasian genus Tetraria, like Costularia, is polyphyletic. This pattern is morphologically consistent and suggests that these genera require realignment.},

	abstract = {Traditional Cariceae and Carex (1966 spp.) classifications recognised five genera (Carex, Cymophyllus, Kobresia, Schoenoxiphium, Uncinia) and four subgenera (Carex, Vignea, Vigneastra, Psyllophora). However, molecular studies have shown that only Carex, divided into five major lineages (the Core Carex, Schoenoxiphium, Core Unispicate, Vignea and Siderostictae Clades), is natural. These studies have also suggested that many early diverging tribal lineages are East Asian in origin, but the sampling of East Asian groups has been poor, and support for relationships within and among major Cariceae clades has been weak. To test deep patterns of relationship in Carex we assembled the longest sequence dataset yet (ITS, ETS 1f, matK, ndhF, rps16; ca. 4400bp) with taxonomic sampling focused on critical East and Southeast Asian Carex sections that have blurred subgeneric limits (Decorae, Graciles, Mundae) or have been at the heart of theories on tribal origins (Hemiscaposae, Indicae, Surculosae, Euprepes, Mapaniifoliae, Hypolytroides). Results indicate that subg. Vigneastra is highly polyphyletic (in five of seven major lineages recognised), and they provide the strongest support yet seen for all previously recognised major Cariceae clades in a single analysis (⩾93\% BS). Moreover, results provide strong evidence for three previously unrecognised early diverging East and Southeast Asian lineages: a "Hypolytroides Clade" (sect. Hypolytroides) sister to the Siderostictae Clade, and for a "Dissitiflora Lineage" (sect. Mundae) and a morphologically diverse "Small Core Carex Clade" (sects. Graciles, Decorae, Mapaniifoliae, Euprepes, Indicae) as successive sisters to approximately 1400 species in the Core Carex Clade. Our findings also suggest that morphological diversification may have occurred in clades dominated by Asian species followed by canalization to a narrower range of morphologies in species-rich, cosmopolitan lineages.},

Here we employ a new dated phylogenetic hypothesis for the sedge genus Tetraria, one of the smaller Cape floral clades, to develop an understanding of timing and rates of diversification in the group. Specifically, we test whether diversification in Tetraria slowed as the number of extant lineages increased, suggesting that available ecological niche space has become increasingly saturated through time. The radiation of Tetraria began approximately 18million years ago, concordant with that of many other Cape clades. Diversification rates in the genus showed no drastic shifts in response to major environmental changes, but declined as lineage diversity accumulated, indicative of ecological limitation on speciation rates. This allows the development of heuristic predictions about the composition of Tetraria assemblages at various spatial scales, and suggests that closely related species should either be ecologically differentiated or have non-overlapping geographic distributions. The question of whether ecological limitation of diversity is a common phenomenon in other Cape lineages has important implications for our understanding of the evolution and ecology of the contemporary Cape flora as a whole.},

In subfamily Mapanioideae there is particular specialization of the inflorescence into units termed spicoids. The structural homology of the spicoid is difficult to interpret, making determination of intrafamilial relationships problematic. To address this, pollen from eight species in Mapanioideae was investigated using light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Pollen development was also examined to identify the type of pollen present in these species. We also analyzed DNA sequence data using the trnL-F and rps16 regions from 25 genera and 35 species of Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, and Thurniaceae. Two types of pollen, Mapania-type and pseudomonad, were identifed. Analysis of combined DNA and pollen data resolved a clade sister to the rest of Cyperaceae, corresponding to Mapanioideae. Within this, two further clades were resolved. One comprised taxa assigned to tribe Hypolytreae, which had Mapania-type pollen. The other comprised taxa mainly assigned to tribe Chrysitricheae, but included two taxa from Hypolytreae, Capitularina and Exocarya. All taxa in this clade had pseudomonad pollen. Thus new groupings within the subfamily have been discovered based on the specialization of some taxa in terms of their pollination biology.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Relationships among closely related and recently diverged taxa can be especially difficult to resolve. Here we use both Sanger sequencing and next-generation RADseq data sets to estimate phylogenetic relationships among species of Carex section Racemosae (Cyperaceae), a clade largely restricted to high latitudes and elevations. Interest in relationships among these taxa derives from questions about the species' biogeographic histories and possible links between diversification and Pleistocene glaciations. METHODS A combination of approaches and molecular markers were used to estimate relationships among Carex species within sect. Racemosae and taxa from closely related sections. Nuclear and chloroplast loci generated by Sanger sequencing were analyzed with *BEAST, and SNP data from RADseq loci were analyzed as a concatenated data set using maximum likelihood and as independent loci using SVDquartets. KEY RESULTS Sanger sequencing data sets resolved relationships among taxa at intermediate phylogenetic depths (albeit with low levels of support). Only the RADseq data resolved relationships with strong support at all phylogenetic depths. Moreover, different methods and data partitions of the RADseq data resulted in nearly identical topologies. Carex sect. Racemosae is a strongly supported clade, although a handful of species were found to group with closely related sections. Herbarium specimens up to 35 yr old successfully produced informative RADseq data. CONCLUSIONS Despite the short read lengths of RADseq data, they nevertheless resolved relationships that Sanger sequencing data did not. Resolution of the phylogenetic relationships among recently and rapidly diversifying taxa within sect. Racemosae clades suggest a role for the Pleistocene glaciations in clade diversification.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED • PREMISE OF THE STUDY The circumboreal Carex section Glareosae comprises 20-25 currently accepted species. High variability in geographic distribution, ecology, cytogenetics, and morphology has led to historical problems both in species delimitation and in circumscribing the limits of the section, which is one of the major tasks facing caricologists today.• METHODS We performed phylogenetic reconstructions based on ETS, ITS, G3PDH, and matK DNA sequences from 204 samples. Concatenation of gene regions in a supermatrix approach to phylogenetic reconstruction was compared to coalescent-based species-tree estimation. Ancestral state reconstructions were performed for eight morphological characters to evaluate correspondence between phylogeny and traits used in traditional classification within the section.• KEY RESULTS The results confirm the existence of a core Glareosae comprising 23-25 species. Most species constitute exclusive lineages, and relationships among species are highly resolved with both the supermatrix and coalescent-based species-tree approaches. We used ancestral state reconstruction to investigate sources of homoplasy underlying traditional taxonomy and species circumscription. We found that even species apparently not constituting exclusive lineages are morphologically homogeneous, raising the question of whether paraphyly of species is a phylogenetic artifact in our study or evidence of widespread homoplasy in characters used to define species.• CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the monophyly of Carex section Glareosae and establishes a phylogenetic framework for the section. Homoplasy makes many of morphological characters difficult to apply for taxon delimitation. The strong concordance between supermatrix and species-tree approaches to phylogenetic reconstructions suggests that even in the face of incongruence among molecular markers, section-level or species-level phylogenies in Carex are tractable.},

	abstract = {For over a century, the origins and mechanisms underlying the diversification of the enormous temperate genus Carex ({\textgreater}2100 species; Cariceae, Cyperaceae) have remained largely speculative. Characteristics such as its diverse ecology, varied biogeography, and intriguing cytology have made Carex a powerful model for studying plant evolution, but its uncertain sister-group relationships hinder its use in studies that depend on accurate ancestral state estimates and biogeographic inferences. To identify the sister to Carex, we estimated the phylogeny of all genera in the Cariceae-Dulichieae-Scirpeae clade (CDS) using three plastid and two nuclear ribosomal markers. Ancestral state reconstructions of key characters were made, and a time-calibrated tree estimated. Carex is strongly supported as sister to the rare East Asian Sumatroscirpus, sole genus of a new tribe, Sumatroscirpeae trib. nov. Believed to be unique to Carex, the perigynium (prophyllar bract enclosing a flower) is in fact a synapomorphy shared with this small tribe (∼4 species) that appeared 36 Mya. We thus suggest the initial key innovation in the remarkable diversification of Carex is not the perigynium, but could be the release of mechanical constraints on perigynia through spikelet truncation, resulting in novel adaptive morphologies. Monoecy, chromosomal change, and rapid inflorescence development enabling phenological isolation may also be involved. The tiny tribe Sumatroscirpeae will provide unprecedented insights into the inflorescence homology, evolution, diversification, and biogeographic history of its sister-group Carex, one of the world's most diverse plant lineages.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY Natural hybridization represents an important force driving plant evolution and affecting community structure and functioning. Hybridization may be overlooked, however, among morphologically highly uniform congeners. An excellent example of such a group is Eleocharis subgenus Limnochloa, which has no reliably proven hybrids. Does this reflect biological barriers to interspecific crosses or difficulties in detecting the hybrids? We tested the hypothesis that hybridization occurs among sympatric Eleocharis cellulosa, E. interstincta, and E. mutata in northern Belize, Central America. • METHODS Morphometric study (407 plants) was followed by examination of inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) polymorphisms (44 plants) and ITS sequence variation (33 plants). • KEY RESULTS Two putatively hybrid morphotypes were discerned-E. cellulosa-resembling and E. interstincta-resembling. DNA markers of E. cellulosa and E. interstincta displayed additive constitution in plants from one E. cellulosa-resembling population only. The other putatively hybrid populations contained ISSR and ITS markers of the species they resembled morphologically, several unique ISSR markers, and ITS sequences of an undescribed South American Limnochloa entity. DNA markers of E. mutata were absent in the putative hybrids. • CONCLUSIONS Simultaneous use of various types of molecular markers can overcome many pitfalls of investigations concerning hybridization among closely related and morphologically similar species. Northern Belize represents a hybrid zone of E. cellulosa and E. interstincta. A third participant in the hybridization events occurring in this zone is an unknown Limnochloa lineage but is not E. mutata. Interspecific hybridization may play a significant role in the diversification of Eleocharis.},

Three molecular data and two combined data sets were used to obtain robust and detailed phylogenetic trees by using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference, respectively. We analyzed 81 genera and 426 species of Cyperaceae, including Korean species. We suggest one early diverged group (EDGs), and two major clades (FAEC and SDC) within the subfamily Cyperoideae. And the clade EDGs comprises six tribes (Schoeneae, Bisboeckelereae, Sclerieae, Cryptangieae, Trilepideae, and Rhynchosporeae) at the basal nodes of Cyperoideae. The FAEC clade (posterior probability [PP]/bootstrap value [BS] = 1.00/85) comprises four tribes (Fuireneae, Abildgaardieae, Eleocharideae, Cypereae), and the SDC clade (PP/BS = 1.00/86) comprises three tribes (Scirpeae, Dulichieae, Cariceae). These three clades used for phylogenetic groups in our study will be useful for establishing the major lineage of the sedge family.

	abstract = {In this article, we use supermatrix data-mining methods to reconstruct a large, highly inclusive phylogeny of Cyperaceae from nucleotide data available on GenBank. We explore the properties of these trees and their utility for phylogenetic inference, and show that even the highly incomplete alignments characteristic of supermatrix approaches may yield very good estimates of phylogeny. We present a novel pipeline for filtering sparse alignments to improve their phylogenetic utility by maximizing the partial decisiveness of the matrices themselves through a technique we call "phylogenetic scaffolding," and we present a new method of scoring tip instability (i.e. "rogue taxa") based on the I statistic implemented in the software Mesquite. The modified statistic, which we call I(S), is somewhat more straightforward to interpret than similar statistics, and our implementation of it may be applied to large sets of large trees. The largest sedge trees presented here contain more than 1500 tips (about one quarter of all sedge species) and are based on multigene alignments with more than 20 000 sites and more than 90\% missing data. These trees match well with previously supported phylogenetic hypotheses, but have lower overall support values and less resolution than more heavily filtered trees. Our best-resolved trees are characterized by stronger support values than any previously published sedge phylogenies, and show some relationships that are incongruous with previous studies. Overall, we show that supermatrix methods offer powerful means of pursuing phylogenetic study and these tools have high potential value for many systematic biologists.},

Internal transcribed spacer and 5'-trnK intron plastid gene sequences were analyzed to determine (1) the times of diversification using penalized likelihood, and (2) reconstructions of the regions using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches of origin of sect. Spirostachyae and internal main lineages. The times for the diversification of sect.

In this study, we evaluated alternative evolutionary models to test for such transitions in Carex section Spirostachyae as well as the relative effects of several plausible drivers of intraspecific chromosome diversity. Chromosome number variation in section Spirostachyae shows significant phylogenetic signal, but no evidence of clade-specific shifts in chromosome number distribution. This gradual model of chromosome evolution contrasts with the shifting equilibrium model previously identified in a younger section of the same genus, suggesting that section Spirostachyae may have a more slowly evolving karyotype. Chromosome number variance, on the other hand, exhibits low phylogenetic signal. Average time of coalescence rather than geographic range or chromosome number itself predicts chromosome number variance, demonstrating a previously unreported relationship between population history and cytogenetic variation.},

Here, we used a Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) approach to sample a reduced representation genomic data set and infer the phylogeny of seven closely related species in the genus Carex (Cyperaceae). Past attempts to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among these species produced conflicting and poorly-supported results. We inferred a robust phylogeny based on {\textgreater}3000 GBS loci and {\textgreater}1300 SNPs (with a minimum sequence depth within individuals of 10) using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. We also tested for historical introgression using the D-statistic test. We compared these analyses with partitioned RAD analysis, which is designed to identify suboptimal trees reflecting secondary phylogenetic signal that may be obscured by the dominant signal in the data. Phylogenetic analyses yielded fully resolved trees with high support. We found two main clades, one grouping Carex scoparia populations and C. waponahkikensis, and a second clade grouping C. longii, C. vexans, C. suberecta and C. albolutescens. We detected marginally significant signals of introgression between C. scoparia and C. suberecta or C. albolutescens, and we rejected a hybrid origin hypothesis for C. waponahkikensis.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Cyperus esculentus is widespread in tropical and temperate zones and is also present in cooler regions. It is used as a crop plant, but it also occurs in the wild and as a weed. As a consequence of its ecological plasticity, C. esculentus has remarkable variability, with several morphotypes. Four wild-type varieties are presently recognized, in addition to the cultivated form. This study investigates the phylogenetic position and biogeography of C. esculentus with the objective of contributing new data to increase the understanding of its evolutionary history. METHODS Genealogical relationships among genotypes were inferred by using plastid DNA haplotype and nuclear ribosomal (nr) DNA ribotype sequences for 70 specimens either collected in the field or obtained from herbaria. Statistical dispersal-vicariance (S-DIVA) and Bayesian binary method (BBM) analyses were used to reconstruct the possible ancestral ranges of C. esculentus. In order to determine the age of C. esculentus, a time-measured phylogenetic analysis was performed. KEY RESULTS Considerable variation between the chosen nuclear and plastid markers was detected (27 ribotypes vs. six haplotypes). No geographical structure was displayed among the haplotypes, but information on the dispersal pattern may be deduced. Two types of ribotypes were detected in nrDNA, with an evident geographical segregation into an Old World group and a polymorphic New World group. Both S-DIVA and BBM analyses suggested a biogeographical history in which dispersal from the African region has been crucial in shaping the current distribution pattern of C. esculentus. The most recent common ancestor between C. esculentus races has an age of 5.1 million years (95 \% highest posterior density 2.5-10.2). CONCLUSIONS The molecular analysis provides novel insights into the evolutionary history of C. esculentus. The results have various taxonomic and phylogenetic implications, including a hypothesis on the origin and phylogeography of this species, which probably originated in the late Cenozoic in Africa, and reached the Americas repeatedly, independently of Columbian exchanges.},

	abstract = {Molecular studies of six species from the ancient extant seed plant Cycas, covering a wide range of its morphological diversity and all major areas of distribution, revealed a high level of intra-individual polymorphism of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) region, indicative of incomplete nrDNA concerted evolution. Through a range of comparisons of sequence characteristics to functional cDNA ITS copies, including sequence length and substitution variation, GC content, secondary structure stability, the presence of a conserved motif in the 5.8S gene, and evolutionary rates, the PCR amplified divergent genomic DNA ITS paralogs were identified as either putative pseudogenes, recombinants or functional paralogs. This incomplete ITS concerted evolution may be linked to the high number of nucleolar organizer regions in the Cycas genome, and the incomplete lineage sorting due to recent species divergence in the genus. Based on the distribution of a 14 bp deletion, an early evolutionary origin of the pseudogenes is indicated, possibly predating the diversification of Cycas. Due to their early origin combined with the unconstraint evolution of the ITS region in pseudogenes, they accumulate high levels of homoplastic mutations. This leads to random relationships among the pseudogenes due to long-branch attractions, whereas the phylogenetic relationships inferred from the functional ITS paralogs grouped the sequences in species specific clades (except for C. circinalis and C. rumphii). The findings of our extensive study will have a wide significance, for the evolution of these molecular sequences, and their utilization as a major marker for reconstructing phylogenies.},

	abstract = {Cycas is the most widespread and diverse genus among the ancient cycads, but the extant species could be the product of late Miocene rapid radiations. Taxonomic treatments to date for this genus are quite controversial, which makes it difficult to elucidate its evolutionary history. We cloned 161 genomic ITS sequences from 31 species representing all sections of Cycas. The divergent ITS paralogs were examined within each species and identified as putative pseudogenes, recombinants and functional paralogs. Functional paralogs were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships with pseudogene sequences as molecular outgroups, since an unambiguous ITS sequence alignment with their closest relatives, the Zamiaceae, is unachievable. A fully resolved and highly supported tree topology was obtained at the section level, with two major clades including six minor clades. The results fully supported the classification scheme proposed by Hill (2004) at the section level, with the minor clades representing his six sections. The two major clades could be recognised as two subgenera. The obtained pattern of phylogenetic relationships, combined with the different seed dispersal capabilities and paleogeography, allowed us to propose a late Miocene rapid radiation of Cycas that might have been promoted by vicariant events associated with the complex topography and orogeny of South China and adjacent regions. In contrast, transoceanic dispersals might have played an important role in the rapid diversification of sect. Cycas, whose members have evolved a spongy layer in their seeds aiding water dispersals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Despite a recent new classification, a stable phylogeny for the cycads has been elusive, particularly regarding resolution of Bowenia, Stangeria and Dioon. In this study, five single-copy nuclear genes (SCNGs) are applied to the phylogeny of the order Cycadales. The specific aim is to evaluate several gene tree-species tree reconciliation approaches for developing an accurate phylogeny of the order, to contrast them with concatenated parsimony analysis and to resolve the erstwhile problematic phylogenetic position of these three genera. METHODS DNA sequences of five SCNGs were obtained for 20 cycad species representing all ten genera of Cycadales. These were analysed with parsimony, maximum likelihood (ML) and three Bayesian methods of gene tree-species tree reconciliation, using Cycas as the outgroup. A calibrated date estimation was developed with Bayesian methods, and biogeographic analysis was also conducted. KEY RESULTS Concatenated parsimony, ML and three species tree inference methods resolve exactly the same tree topology with high support at most nodes. Dioon and Bowenia are the first and second branches of Cycadales after Cycas, respectively, followed by an encephalartoid clade (Macrozamia-Lepidozamia-Encephalartos), which is sister to a zamioid clade, of which Ceratozamia is the first branch, and in which Stangeria is sister to Microcycas and Zamia. CONCLUSIONS A single, well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis of the generic relationships of the Cycadales is presented. However, massive extinction events inferred from the fossil record that eliminated broader ancestral distributions within Zamiaceae compromise accurate optimization of ancestral biogeographical areas for that hypothesis. While major lineages of Cycadales are ancient, crown ages of all modern genera are no older than 12 million years, supporting a recent hypothesis of mostly Miocene radiations. This phylogeny can contribute to an accurate infrafamilial classification of Zamiaceae.},

Based on morphology, the genus has been divided into six sections and eight subsections, but this taxonomy has not yet been tested in a molecular phylogenetic framework. Although the monophyly of Cycas is broadly accepted, the intrageneric relationships inferred from previous molecular phylogenetic analyses are unclear due to insufficient sampling or uninformative DNA sequence data. In this study, we reconstructed a phylogeny of Cycas using four chloroplast intergenic spacers and seven low-copy nuclear genes and sampling 90\% of extant Cycas species. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenies suggest: (1) matrices of either concatenated cpDNA markers or of concatenated nDNA lack sufficient informative sites to resolve the phylogeny alone, however, the phylogeny from the combined cpDNA-nDNA dataset suggests the genus can be roughly divided into 13 clades and six sections that are in agreement with the current classification of the genus; (2) although with partial support, a clade combining sections Panzhihuaenses + Asiorientales is resolved as the earliest diverging branch; (3) section Stangerioides is not monophyletic because the species resolve as a grade; (4) section Indosinenses is not monophyletic as it includes Cycas macrocarpa and C. pranburiensis from section Cycas; (5) section Cycas is the most derived group and its subgroups correspond with geography.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Bayesian relaxed-clock dating has significantly influenced our understanding of the timeline of biotic evolution. This approach requires the use of priors on the branching process, yet little is known about their impact on divergence time estimates. We investigated the effect of branching priors using the iconic cycads. We conducted phylogenetic estimations for 237 cycad species using three genes and two calibration strategies incorporating up to six fossil constraints to (i) test the impact of two different branching process priors on age estimates, (ii) assess which branching prior better fits the data, (iii) investigate branching prior impacts on diversification analyses, and (iv) provide insights into the diversification history of cycads. RESULTS Using Bayes factors, we compared divergence time estimates and the inferred dynamics of diversification when using Yule versus birth-death priors. Bayes factors were calculated with marginal likelihood estimated with stepping-stone sampling. We found striking differences in age estimates and diversification dynamics depending on prior choice. Dating with the Yule prior suggested that extant cycad genera diversified in the Paleogene and with two diversification rate shifts. In contrast, dating with the birth-death prior yielded Neogene diversifications, and four rate shifts, one for each of the four richest genera. Nonetheless, dating with the two priors provided similar age estimates for the divergence of cycads from Ginkgo (Carboniferous) and their crown age (Permian). Of these, Bayes factors clearly supported the birth-death prior. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest the choice of the branching process prior can have a drastic influence on our understanding of evolutionary radiations. Therefore, all dating analyses must involve a model selection process using Bayes factors to select between a Yule or birth-death prior, in particular on ancient clades with a potential pattern of high extinction. We also provide new insights into the history of cycad diversification because we found (i) periods of extinction along the long branches of the genera consistent with fossil data, and (ii) high diversification rates within the Miocene genus radiations.},

All datasets indicate that Cycadaceae (including only the genus Cycas) is remotely related to other cycads, in which Dioon was resolved as the basal-most clade, followed by Bowenia and a clade containing the remaining nine genera. Encephalartos and Lepidozamia are closer to each other than to Macrozamia. The African genus Stangeria is embedded within the New World subfamily Zamiodeae. Therefore, Bowenia is an unlikely sister to Stangeria, contrary to the view that they form the Stangeriaceae. The generic status of Dyerocycas and Chigua is unsupportable as they are paraphyletic with Cycas and the Zamia, respectively. Nonsense mutations in the matK gene and indels in the other two datasets lend evidence to reinforce the above conclusions. According to the phylogenies, the past geography of the genera of cycads and the evolution of character states are hypothesized and discussed. Within the suborder Zamiieae, Stangeria, and the tribe Zamieae evolved significantly faster than other genera. The matK gene and ITS/5.8S region contain more useful information than the trnK intron in addressing phylogeny.

	abstract = {Obligate pollination mutualisms are rare and few have been investigated deeply. This paper focuses on one such mutualism involving thrips in the genus Cycadothrips that pollinate cycads in the genus Macrozamia. Both represent old lineages relative to insects and plants generally, are endemic to Australia, and are mutually co-dependent. The phylogenetic analyses presented here demonstrate that the pollinator is much more diverse than previously considered, with each pollinator lineage being extremely specific to between one and three host species where these latter share part of their distribution. The new species diversity we demonstrate in Cycadothrips all presently falls under the species name C. chadwicki, and these different lineages diversified during two periods. An older divergence, beginning 7.3Mya (4.4-11.1, 95\% HPD), resulted in three major lineages, and then further diversification within each of these three lineages took place at most 1.1Mya (0.6-1.8, 95\% HPD). These divergence estimates correspond to times when aridification was increasing in Australia, suggesting that population fragmentation following climatic change has played a significant role in the evolutionary history of Cycadothrips and Macrozamia. This means that co-diversification of the host and pollinator in allopatry appears to be the dominant process affecting species diversity. Host switching is also clearly evident in the discrepancy between the divergence times of the C. chadwicki lineage and C. albrechti, about 10.8Mya (6.0-17.1, 95\% HPD), and their hosts, at about 1.1Mya (0.2-3.4Mya, 95\% HPD), in that the pollinator split pre-dates the origin of the associated host species of each. These results add to the body of evidence that the evolutionary processes important in obligate pollinator mutualisms are more varied than previously assumed.},

In addition, possible origins of all three polyploid conifers were investigated, and a hybrid origin was suggested for Cupressus, Fitzroya and Sequoia.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Although allopatric speciation is viewed as the most common way in which species originate, allopatric divergence among a group of closely related species has rarely been examined at the population level through phylogeographic analysis. Here we report such a case study on eight putative cypress (Cupressus) species, which each have a mainly allopatric distribution in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjacent regions. The analysis involved sequencing three plastid DNA fragments (trnD-trnT, trnS-trnG and trnL-trnF) in 371 individuals sampled from populations at 66 localities. RESULTS Both phylogenetic and network analyses showed that most DNA haplotypes recovered or haplotype-clustered lineages resolved were largely species-specific. Across all species, significant phylogeographic structure (N(ST) {\textgreater} G(ST), P {\textless} 0.05) implied a high correlation between haplotypes/lineages and geographic distribution. Two species, C. duclouxiana and C. chengiana, which are distributed in the eastern QTP region, contained more haplotypes and higher diversity than five species with restricted distributions in the western highlands of the QTP. The remaining species, C. funebris, is widely cultivated and contained very little cpDNA diversity. CONCLUSIONS It is concluded that the formation of high mountain barriers separating deep valleys in the QTP and adjacent regions caused by various uplifts of the plateau since the early Miocene most likely promoted allopatric divergence in Cupressus by restricting gene flow and fixing local, species-specific haplotypes in geographically isolated populations. The low levels of intraspecific diversity present in most species might stem from population bottlenecks brought about by recurrent periods of unfavorable climate and more recently by the negative impacts of human activities on species' distributions. Our findings shed new light on the importance of geographical isolation caused by the uplift of the QTP on the development of high plant species diversity in the QTP biodiversity hotspot.},

	abstract = {The eastern Asia-North America disjunction is one of the most interesting biogeographical patterns, but its formation is still in much debate. Here nucleotide sequences of five cpDNA regions, nrDNA ITS and two low-copy nuclear genes (LEAFY, 4CL) were employed to reconstruct the phylogeny and to explore the historical biogeography of Thuja, a typical eastern Asia-North America disjunct genus. High topological discordance was observed between chloroplast and nuclear gene trees, even between different nuclear gene trees, suggesting that Thuja could have a reticulate evolutionary history due to multiple interspecific hybridization events. The eastern Asian species Thuja koraiensis might have obtained its chloroplast genome from the eastern North American species T. occidentalis by chloroplast capture, while the western North American species T. plicata is very likely to have inherited a recombinant cpDNA. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of multiple genes, DIVA-reconstruction of the distribution history, molecular clock estimation and fossil data, we inferred that Thuja could have originated from the high-latitude areas of North America in the Paleocene or earlier with subsequent expansion into eastern Asia through the Bering Land Bridge. The two eastern Asia species T. standishii and T. sutchuenensis have a sister relationship, and their split could have occurred in the Oligocene or early Miocene. In the present study, the selection of molecular markers in biogeographic studies was also discussed. Since most previous studies on the eastern Asia and North America disjunction are based on uniparentally inherited cpDNA and (or) directly sequenced nrDNA ITS data, the historical reticulate evolution in the studied groups might have been underestimated. Therefore, we suggest that multiple genes from different genomes, especially low-copy nuclear genes, be used in this research area in the future.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ympev.2005.10.002},
	abstract = {The Cucurbitales are a clade of rosids with a worldwide distribution and a striking heterogeneity in species diversity among its seven family members: the Anisophylleaceae (29-40 species), Begoniaceae (1400 spp.), Coriariaceae (15 spp.), Corynocarpaceae (6 spp.), Cucurbitaceae (800 spp.), Datiscaceae (2 spp.), and Tetramelaceae (2 spp.). Most Cucurbitales have unisexual flowers, and species are monoecious, dioecious, andromonoecious, or androdioecious. To resolve interfamilial relationships within the order and to polarize morphological character evolution, especially of flower sexual systems, we sequenced nine plastids (atpB, matK, ndhF, rbcL, the trnL-F region, and the rpl20-rps12 spacer), nuclear (18S and 26S rDNA), and mitochondrial (nad1 b/c intron) genes (together approximately 12,000 bp) of 26 representatives of the seven families plus eight outgroup taxa from six other orders of the Eurosids I. Cucurbitales are strongly supported as monophyletic and are closest to Fagales, albeit with moderate support; both together are sister to Rosales. The deepest split in the Cucurbitales is that between the Anisophylleaceae and the remaining families; next is a clade of Corynocarpaceae and Coriariaceae, followed by Cucurbitaceae, which are sister to a clade of Begoniaceae, Datiscaceae, and Tetramelaceae. Based on this topology, stipulate leaves, inferior ovaries, parietal placentation, and one-seeded fruits are inferred as ancestral in Cucurbitales; exstipulate leaves, superior ovaries, apical placentation, and many-seeded fruits evolved within the order. Bisexual flowers are reconstructed as ancestral, but dioecy appears to have evolved already in the common ancestor of Begoniaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Datiscaceae, and Tetramelaceae, and then to have been lost repeatedly in Begoniaceae and Cucurbitaceae. Both instances of androdioecy (Datisca glomerata and Schizopepon bryoniifolius) evolved from dioecious ancestors, corroborating recent hypotheses about androdioecy often evolving from dioecy.},

Bryonia ranges from the Canary Islands to Central Asia and comprises seven dioecious and three monoecious species; its closest relative, Ecballium elaterium, has dioecious and monoecious populations. We used chloroplast (cp) and nuclear (nr) gene phylogenies to infer sexual system evolution in Bryonia. We also tested for associations between sexual system and ploidy level, based on published and original chromosome counts. Conflicts between cp and nr topologies imply that the dioecious hexaploid B. cretica arose from hybridization(s), probably involving the dioecious diploids B. dioica, B. syriaca, and/or B. multiflora. A tetraploid dioecious endemic on Corsica and Sardinia probably originated from B. dioica via autopolyploidy. While the cp phylogeny resolves few species relationships, the nr tree implies at least two evolutionary changes in sexual system. There is no correlation between sexual system and ploidy level. Molecular clocks suggest that the deepest divergence, between a species on the Canary Islands and the ancestor of all remaining species, occurred ca. 10 million years ago.},

Confusion is amplified in Psiguria, a small genus found in Central and South America and the Caribbean, because male and female flowers of these monoecious plants are widely separated by time and position on a branch. We present the first phylogeny of Psiguria utilizing a combination of eight chloroplast intergenic spacers, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat, and the intron of the low-copy nuclear gene serine/threonine phosphatase, for a total aligned length of 9456 base pairs. Analyses include multiple accessions of all species in the genus. The data support the monophyly of Psiguria and elucidate several species boundaries. Also presented are Psiguria-specific DNA barcodes, which include the chloroplast regions: ndhC-trnV, rps16-trnQ, rpoB-trnC, ndhF-rpl32, and psbZ-trnM.

Monoecy evolved from dioecy seven times independently, always in Africa and mostly in savanna species with low population densities. Leaky dioecy, with occasional fruit-producing males, occurs in two African species and might be the first step in an evolutionary transition towards monoecy. Dated biogeographic analyses suggest that Momordica originated in tropical Africa and that the Asian species are the result of one long-distance dispersal event about 19million years ago.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Melon, Cucumis melo, and cucumber, C. sativus, are among the most widely cultivated crops worldwide. Cucumis, as traditionally conceived, is geographically centered in Africa, with C. sativus and C. hystrix thought to be the only Cucumis species in Asia. This taxonomy forms the basis for all ongoing Cucumis breeding and genomics efforts. We tested relationships among Cucumis and related genera based on DNA sequences from chloroplast gene, intron, and spacer regions (rbcL, matK, rpl20-rps12, trnL, and trnL-F), adding nuclear internal transcribed spacer sequences to resolve relationships within Cucumis. RESULTS Analyses of combined chloroplast sequences (4,375 aligned nucleotides) for 123 of the 130 genera of Cucurbitaceae indicate that the genera Cucumella, Dicaelospermum, Mukia, Myrmecosicyos, and Oreosyce are embedded within Cucumis. Phylogenetic trees from nuclear sequences for these taxa are congruent, and the combined data yield a well-supported phylogeny. The nesting of the five genera in Cucumis greatly changes the natural geographic range of the genus, extending it throughout the Malesian region and into Australia. The closest relative of Cucumis is Muellerargia, with one species in Australia and Indonesia, the other in Madagascar. Cucumber and its sister species, C. hystrix, are nested among Australian, Malaysian, and Western Indian species placed in Mukia or Dicaelospermum and in one case not yet formally described. Cucumis melo is sister to this Australian/Asian clade, rather than being close to African species as previously thought. Molecular clocks indicate that the deepest divergences in Cucumis, including the split between C. melo and its Australian/Asian sister clade, go back to the mid-Eocene. CONCLUSION Based on congruent nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies we conclude that Cucumis comprises an old Australian/Asian component that was heretofore unsuspected. Cucumis sativus evolved within this Australian/Asian clade and is phylogenetically far more distant from C. melo than implied by the current morphological classification.},

Indofevillea khasiana is sister to all other Cucurbitoideae, and the genera of Joliffieae plus a few Trichosantheae form a grade near the base of Cucurbitoideae. A newly discovered large clade consists of the ancestrally Asian genera Nothoalsomitra, Luffa, Gymnopetalum, Hodgsonia, Trichosanthes, and the New World tribe Sicyeae.

Previous phylogenetic studies of the six Cucurbita crop lineages (pumpkins and squashes) and their wild relatives suggest histories of deep coalescence that complicate uncovering the genetic origins of the six crop taxa. We investigated the evolution of wild and domesticated Cucurbita using the most comprehensive and robust molecular-based phylogeny for Cucurbita to date based on 44 loci derived from introns of single-copy nuclear genes. We discovered novel relationships among Cucurbita species and recovered the first Cucurbita tree with well-supported resolution within species. Cucurbita comprises a clade of mesophytic annual species that includes all six crop taxa and a grade of xerophytic perennial species that represent the ancestral xerophytic habit of the genus. Based on phylogenetic resolution within-species we hypothesize that the magnitude of domestication bottlenecks varies among Cucurbita crop lineages. Our phylogeny clarifies how wild Cucurbita species are related to the domesticated taxa. We find close relationships between two wild species and crop lineages not previously identified. Expanded geographic sampling of key wild species is needed for improved understanding of the evolution of domesticated Cucurbita.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Conservatism in climatic tolerance may limit geographic range expansion and should enhance the effects of habitat fragmentation on population subdivision. Here we study the effects of historical climate change, and the associated habitat fragmentation, on diversification in the mostly sub-Saharan cucurbit genus Coccinia, which has 27 species in a broad range of biota from semi-arid habitats to mist forests. Species limits were inferred from morphology, and nuclear and plastid DNA sequence data, using multiple individuals for the widespread species. Climatic tolerances were assessed from the occurrences of 1189 geo-referenced collections and WorldClim variables. RESULTS Nuclear and plastid gene trees included 35 or 65 accessions, representing up to 25 species. The data revealed four species groups, one in southern Africa, one in Central and West African rain forest, one widespread but absent from Central and West African rain forest, and one that occurs from East Africa to southern Africa. A few individuals are differently placed in the plastid and nuclear (LFY) trees or contain two ITS sequence types, indicating hybridization. A molecular clock suggests that the diversification of Coccinia began about 6.9 Ma ago, with most of the extant species diversity dating to the Pliocene. Ancestral biome reconstruction reveals six switches between semi-arid habitats, woodland, and forest, and members of several species pairs differ significantly in their tolerance of different precipitation regimes. CONCLUSIONS The most surprising findings of this study are the frequent biome shifts (in a relatively small clade) over just 6 - 7 million years and the limited diversification during and since the Pleistocene. Pleistocene climate oscillations may have been too rapid or too shallow for full reproductive barriers to develop among fragmented populations of Coccinia, which would explain the apparently still ongoing hybridization between certain species. Steeper ecological gradients in East Africa and South Africa appear to have resulted in more advanced allopatric speciation there.},

	abstract = {Cucumis (Cucurbitaceae) comprises 33 species of annuals and perennials with a major native center of diversity in tropical and southern Africa. The genus includes some economically important and widely grown vegetables such as cucumbers and melons. Monophyly of the genus has been disputed in previous studies, but with only limited sampling. Relationships within Cucumis are thus poorly understood; moreover, the validity of the closely related genera has not been thoroughly tested. The present study was undertaken to test the monophyly of Cucumis and several closely related genera, to test sectional circumscriptions within Cucumis, and to understand the biogeographical history of the genus. We sequenced the nuclear ITS and plastid trnS-trnG regions for 40 ingroup and three outgroup taxa, representing all recognized subgenera and sections. Parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses found Cucumella, Oreosyce, Mukia, Myrmecosicyos, and Dicaelospermum nested within Cucumis. The clades recovered within the Cucumis complex in some instances represent the first phylogenetically derived hypothesis of relationships, whereas others correspond to previous subgeneric and sectional classifications. At least four introductions from Africa to Asia, as well as one reintroduction to Africa, are suggested within the Cucumis complex. Cucumis sativus (cucumber) is strongly supported as sister to the eastern Asian C. hystrix, whereas C. melo (melon) is strongly supported as sister to C. sagittatus in southern Africa.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY The Cucurbitaceae genus Cayaponia comprises ∼60 species that occur from Uruguay to the southern United States and the Caribbean; C. africana occurs in West Africa and on Madagascar. Pollination is by bees or bats, raising the question of the evolutionary direction and frequency of pollinator shifts. Studies that investigated such shifts in other clades have suggested that bat pollination might be an evolutionary end point. • METHODS Plastid and nuclear DNA sequences were obtained for 50 accessions representing 30 species of Cayaponia and close relatives, and analyses were carried out to test monophyly, infer divergence times, and reconstruct ancestral states for habitat preferences and pollination modes. • KEY RESULTS The phylogeny shows that Cayaponia is monophyletic as long as Selysia (a genus with four species from Central and South America) is included. The required nomenclatural transfers are made in this paper. African and Madagascan accessions of C. africana form a clade that is part of a polytomy with Caribbean and South American species, and the inferred divergence time of 2-5 Ma implies a transoceanic dispersal event from the New World to Africa. The ancestral state reconstructions suggest that Cayaponia originated in tropical forests from where open savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to savanna habitats. • CONCLUSIONS Cayaponia provides the first example of evolutionary transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa.},

	abstract = {Type specimens are permanently preserved biological specimens that fix the usage of species names. This method became widespread from 1935 onwards and is now obligatory. We used DNA sequencing of types and more recent collections of wild and cultivated melons to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus Citrullus and the correct names for its species. We discovered that the type specimen of the name Citrullus lanatus, prepared by a Linnaean collector in South Africa in 1773, is not the species now thought of as watermelon. Instead, it is a representative of another species that is sister to C. ecirrhosus, a tendril-less South African endemic. The closest relative of the watermelon instead is a West African species. Our nuclear and plastid data furthermore reveal that there are seven species of Citrullus, not four as assumed. Our study implies that sweet watermelon originates from West, not southern Africa as previously believed, and that the South African citron melon has been independently domesticated. These findings affect and explain numerous studies on the origin of these two crops that led to contradictory results because of the erroneous merging of several distinct species.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-12-108},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND The Cucurbitaceae genus Trichosanthes comprises 90-100 species that occur from India to Japan and southeast to Australia and Fiji. Most species have large white or pale yellow petals with conspicuously fringed margins, the fringes sometimes several cm long. Pollination is usually by hawkmoths. Previous molecular data for a small number of species suggested that a monophyletic Trichosanthes might include the Asian genera Gymnopetalum (four species, lacking long petal fringes) and Hodgsonia (two species with petals fringed). Here we test these groups' relationships using a species sampling of c. 60\% and 4759 nucleotides of nuclear and plastid DNA. To infer the time and direction of the geographic expansion of the Trichosanthes clade we employ molecular clock dating and statistical biogeographic reconstruction, and we also address the gain or loss of petal fringes. RESULTS Trichosanthes is monophyletic as long as it includes Gymnopetalum, which itself is polyphyletic. The closest relative of Trichosanthes appears to be the sponge gourds, Luffa, while Hodgsonia is more distantly related. Of six morphology-based sections in Trichosanthes with more than one species, three are supported by the molecular results; two new sections appear warranted. Molecular dating and biogeographic analyses suggest an Oligocene origin of Trichosanthes in Eurasia or East Asia, followed by diversification and spread throughout the Malesian biogeographic region and into the Australian continent. CONCLUSIONS Long-fringed corollas evolved independently in Hodgsonia and Trichosanthes, followed by two losses in the latter coincident with shifts to other pollinators but not with long-distance dispersal events. Together with the Caribbean Linnaeosicyos, the Madagascan Ampelosicyos and the tropical African Telfairia, these cucurbit lineages represent an ideal system for more detailed studies of the evolution and function of petal fringes in plant-pollinator mutualisms.},

(Crassulaceae) is a mid-sized plant genus consisting of about 70 species, with most species distributed on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and the adjacent areas, and several species in north-east Asia, Europe, and North America. This study explored the origin and diversification history of Rhodiola and tested the biogeographic relationships between the QTP and other regions of the Northern Hemisphere. We sequenced the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers and eight plastid DNA fragments representing 55 species of Rhodiola, and reconstructed phylogenetic relationships with maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Several instances of incongruence between the nuclear and the plastid data sets were revealed, which can best be explained by reticulate evolution. Species of Rhodiola and Pseudosedum form a well-supported clade sister to Phedimus. Dating analysis suggested that the origin and diversification times of this group are largely correlated with the extensive uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Ancestral state reconstruction supports the hypothesis that Rhodiola originated on the QTP, and then dispersed to other regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Our findings highlight the importance of the uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in promoting species diversification and the possible role of reticulate evolution in the diversification process. Our results also suggest the biogeographic significance of QTP as the source area in alpine plant evolution in the Northern Hemisphere.},

	abstract = {The order Cornales descends from the earliest split in the Asterid clade of flowering plants. Despite a few phylogenetic studies, relationships among families within Cornales remain unclear. In the present study, we increased taxon and character sampling to further resolve the relationships and to date the early diversification events of the order. We conducted phylogenetic analyses of sequence data from 26S rDNA and six chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) regions using parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian inference (BI) methods with different partition models and different data sets. We employed relaxed, uncorrelated molecular clocks on BEAST to date the phylogeny and examined the effects of different taxon sampling, fossil calibration, and data partitions. Our results from ML and BI analyses of the combined cpDNA sequences and combined cpDNA and 26S rDNA data suggested the monophyly of each family and the following familial relationships ((Cornaceae-Alangiaceae)-(Curtisiaceae-Grubbiaceae))-(((Nyssaceae-Davidiaceae)-Mastixiaceae)-((Hydrostachyaceae-(Hydrangeaceae-Loasaceae))). These relationships were strongly supported by posterior probability and bootstrap values, except for the sister relationship between the N-D-M and H-H-L clades. The 26S rDNA data and some MP trees from cpDNA and total evidence suggested some alternative alignments for Hydrostachyaceae within Cornales, but results of SH tests indicated that these trees were significantly worse explanations of the total data. Phylogenetic dating with simultaneous calibration of multiple nodes suggested that the crown group of Cornales originated around the middle Cretaceous and rapidly radiated into several major clades. The origins of most families dated back to the late Cretaceous except for Curtisiaceae and Grubbiaceae which may have diverged in the very early Tertiary. We found that reducing sampling density within families and analyzing partitioned data sets from coding and noncoding cpDNA, 26S rDNA, and combined data sets produced congruent estimation of divergence times, but reducing the number and changing positions of calibration points resulted in very different estimations.},

In this study, we investigated the evolution of PI-like genes of the MADS-box family in the dogwood genus Cornus (Cornaceae). Cornus is a eudicot lineage in the asterids clade, and is intriguing in evolving petaloid bract morphology in two major lineages within the genus. The gene genealogy reconstructed using genomic DNA and cDNA sequences suggests multiple PI-like gene duplication events in Cornus. An ancient duplication event resulted in two ancient paralogs, CorPI-A and CorPI-B, which have highly diverged intron regions. Duplication of CorPI-A further resulted in two paralogs in one subgroup of Cornus, the BW group that does not produce modified bracts. Most species analyzed were found to contain more than one copy of the PI-like gene with most copies derived recently within species. Estimation and comparison of dN/dS ratios revealed relaxed selection in the PI-like gene in Cornus in comparison with the gene in the closely related outgroups Alangium and Davidia, and in other flowering plants. Selection also differed among major gene copies, CorPI-A and CorPI-B, and among different morphological subgroups of Cornus. Variation in selection pressures may indicate functional changes in PI-like genes after gene duplication and among different lineages. Strong positive selection at three amino acid sites of CorPI was also detected from a region critical for dimerization activity. Total substitution rates of the CorPI gene also differ among lineages of Cornus, showing a trend similar to that found in dN/dS ratios. We also found that the CorPI-A copy contains informative phylogenetic information when compared across species of Cornus.},

The phylogenetic tree shows that the Chile-Papua New Guinea-New Zealand-Pacific islands species and the Central America-northern South America species form a sister group, and the Eurasian clade is more basal to them. The divergence time between the Eurasian group and the other species was estimated as 63 or 59 million years ago using rbcL and matK molecular clocks, respectively.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The water gap is an important morphoanatomical structure in seeds with physical dormancy (PY). It is an environmental signal detector for dormancy break and the route of water into the non-dormant seed. The Convolvulaceae, which consists of subfamilies Convolvuloideae (11 tribes) and Humbertoideae (one tribe, monotypic Humberteae), is the only family in the asterid clade known to produce seeds with PY. The primary aim of this study was to compare the morphoanatomical characteristics of the water gap in seeds of species in the 11 tribes of the Convolvuloideae and to use this information, and that on seed dormancy and storage behaviour, to construct a phylogenetic tree of seed dormancy for the subfamily. METHODS Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to define morphological changes in the hilum area during dormancy break; hand and vibratome sections were taken to describe the anatomy of the water gap, hilum and seed coat; and dye tracking was used to identify the initial route of water entry into the non-dormant seed. Results were compared with a recent cladogram of the family. KEY RESULTS Species in nine tribes have (a) layer(s) of palisade cells in the seed coat, a water gap and orthodox storage behaviour. Erycibe (Erycibeae) and Maripa (Maripeae) do not have a palisade layer in the seed coat or a water gap, and are recalcitrant. The hilar fissure is the water gap in relatively basal Cuscuteae, and bulges adjacent to the micropyle serve as the water gap in the Convolvuloideae, Dicranostyloideae (except Maripeae) and the Cardiochlamyeae clades. Seeds from the Convolvuloideae have morphologically prominent bulges demarcated by cell shape in the sclereid layer, whereas the Dicranostyloideae and Cardiochlamyeae have non-prominent bulges demarcated by the number of sub-cell layers. The anatomy and morphology of the hilar pad follow the same pattern. CONCLUSIONS},

	doi = {10.3732/ajb.1300207},
	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Morning glories are an emerging model system, and resolving phylogenetic relationships is critical for understanding their evolution. Phylogenetic studies demonstrated that the largest morning glory genus, Ipomoea, is not monophyletic, and nine other genera are derived from within Ipomoea. Therefore, systematic research is focused on the monophyletic tribe Ipomoeeae (ca. 650-900 species). We used whole plastomes to infer relationships across Ipomoeeae. METHODS Whole plastomes were sequenced for 29 morning glory species, representing major lineages. Phylogenies were estimated using alignments of 82 plastid genes and whole plastomes. Divergence times were estimated using three fossil calibration points. Finally, evolution of root architecture, flower color, and ergot alkaloid presence was examined. KEY RESULTS Phylogenies estimated from both data sets had nearly identical topologies. Phylogenetic results are generally consistent with prior phylogenetic hypotheses. Higher-level relationships with weak support in previous studies were recovered here with strong support. Molecular dating analysis suggests a late Eocene divergence time for the Ipomoeeae. The two clades within the tribe, Argyreiinae and Astripomoeinae, diversified at similar times. Reconstructed most recent common ancestor of the Ipomoeeae had blue flowers, an association with ergot-producing fungi, and either tuberous or fibrous roots. CONCLUSIONS Phylogenetic results provide confidence in relationships among Ipomoeeae lineages. Divergence time estimation results provide a temporal context for diversification of morning glories. Ancestral character reconstructions support previous findings that morning glory morphology is evolutionarily labile. Taken together, our study provides strong resolution of the morning glory phylogeny, which is broadly applicable to the evolution and ecology of these fascinating species.},

Ipomoea lacunosa and I. cordatotriloba, along with a putative homoploid hybrid, I. ×leucantha, are closely related taxa, which are promising for investigating the early stages of speciation. The objectives of this investigation were to determine how distinct these purported taxa are morphologically and genetically, and to assess the magnitude of reproductive isolation among the taxa. METHODS We measured morphological characteristics and determined genotypes at four microsatellite loci in several populations of each of the taxa in North Carolina and South Carolina to quantify genetic and morphological differentiation. We also included a previously undescribed fourth taxon, which we term 'I. austinii'. KEY RESULTS Our study revealed that all four taxa had distinct but overlapping geographical ranges, and had significantly distinct morphologies. Patterns of microsatellite variation and the results of crosses indicate that I. ×leucantha and I. austinii are morphologically and genetically distinct taxa. Each exhibits substantial reproductive isolation from the other three taxa. By contrast, microsatellite markers indicate that I. lacunosa and I. cordatotriloba exhibit little differentiation at neutral markers, despite substantial morphological differentiation, and exhibit some reproductive isolation. CONCLUSION I. ×leucantha and I. austinii should be considered separate species. Our results provide no evidence that either species originated through homoploid hybrid speciation. I. cordatotriloba and I. lacunosa should be considered incipient species, but may be experiencing considerable reciprocal gene flow.},

Phylogenetic trees based on the three data sets (ITS, rbcL, and PY-IGS) were generated by using maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses. Partition-homogeneity tests indicated that the three data sets and the combined data set are homogeneous. In the combined phylogenetic trees, all ingroup taxa are divided into two main clades, which correspond to the two tribes Laguncularieae and Combreteae. In the Laguncularieae clade, two mangrove genera, Lumnitzera and Laguncularia, are shown to be sister taxa. In the tribe Combreteae, two major clades can be classified: one includes three genera Quisqualis, Combretumand Calycopteris, within which the monophyly of the tribe Combreteae sensu Engler and Diels including Quisqualis and Combretumis strongly supported, and this monophyly is then sister to the monotypic genus Calycopteris; another major clade includes three genera Anogeissus, Terminalia and Conocarpus. There is no support for the monophyly of Terminaliaas it forms a polytomy with Anogeissus. This clade is sister to Conocarpus.},

We present the first phylogeographic analysis of the genus with species from all five of its distribution areas (North Africa, Horn of Africa, Namibia, western South Africa, and eastern South Africa). We used sequence data from six chloroplast regions and one nuclear region. Phylogeographic reconstructions were conducted using both parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. Molecular dating estimates using a Bayesian approach suggest a middle Miocene (13.4+/-1.5 mya) origin of the genus; this approach also provides support for a late Miocene (9.6+/-1.7 mya) diversification in the winter-rainfall area of western South Africa-south of Namibia and strongly influenced by the Benguela current. Three northward dispersion events have been reported in Androcymbium. The first dated to the end of the Miocene (7.0+/-2.0 mya) and gave rise to the genus Colchicum. The second and the third dispersion events took place in the mid Pliocene, rising one from eastern South Africa and originating the only species found in the Horn of Africa (3.0 mya), and the other from Namibia to the Mediterranean basin (4.0 mya). The formation of a late Miocene-Pliocene arid track in the east of Africa is of a great importance to explain these northward dispersions in Androcymbium.},

	abstract = {Cleome is the largest genus in the family Cleomaceae and it is known for its various medicinal properties. Recently, some species from the Cleome genus (Cleome viscosa, Cleome chelidonii, Cleome felina and Cleome speciosa) are split into genera Corynandra (Corynandra viscosa, Corynandra chelidonii, Corynandra felina), and Cleoserrata (Cleoserrata speciosa). The objective of this study was to obtain DNA barcodes for these species for their accurate identification and determining phylogenetic relationships. Out of 10 screened barcoding regions, rbcL, matK and ITS1 regions showed higher PCR efficiency and sequencing success. This study added matK, rbcL and ITS1 barcodes for the identification of Corynandra chelidonii, Corynandra felina, Cleome simplicifolia and Cleome aspera species in existing barcode data. Corynandra chelidonii and Corynandra felina species belong to the Corynandra genus, but they are not grouped with the Corynandra viscosa species, however clustered with the Cleome species. Molecular marker analysis showed 100\% polymorphism among the studied plant samples. Diversity indices for molecular markers were ranged from He=0.1115-0.1714 and I=0.2268-0.2700, which indicates a significant amount of genetic diversity among studied species. Discrimination of the Cleome and Corynandra species from Cleoserrata speciosa was obtained by two RAPD primers (OPA-4 and RAPD-17) and two ISSR primers (ISSR-1 and ISSR-2). RAPD and ISSR markers are useful for the genetic characterization of these studied species. The present investigation will be helpful to understand the relationships of Cleome lineages with Corynandra and Cleoserrata species.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF STUDY A monophyletic group composed of five genera of the Cleomaceae represents an intriguing lineage with outstanding taxonomic and evolutionary questions. Generic boundaries are poorly defined, and historical hypotheses regarding the evolution of fruit type and phylogenetic relationships provide testable questions. This is the first detailed phylogenetic investigation of all 22 species in this group. We use this phylogenetic framework to assess generic monophyly and test Iltis's evolutionary "reduction series" hypothesis regarding phylogeny and fruit type/seed number. • METHODS Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of four plastid intergenic spacer region sequences (rpl32-trnL, trnQ-rps16, ycf1-rps15, and psbA-trnH) and one nuclear (ITS) region were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among the NA cleomoid species. Stochastic mapping and ancestral-state reconstruction were used to study the evolution of fruit type. • KEY RESULTS Both analyses recovered nearly identical phylogenies. Three of the currently recognized genera (Wislizenia, Carsonia, and Oxystylis) are monophyletic while two (Cleomella and Peritoma) are para- or polyphyletic. There was a single origin of the two-seeded schizocarp in the ancestor of the Oxystylis-Wislizenia clade and a secondary derivation of elongated capsule-type fruits in Peritoma from a truncated capsule state in Cleomella. • CONCLUSIONS Our well-resolved phylogeny supports most of the current species circumscriptions but not current generic circumscriptions. Additionally, our results are inconsistent with Iltis's hypothesis of species with elongated many-seed fruits giving rise to species with truncated few-seeded fruits. Instead, we find support for the reversion to elongated multiseeded fruits from a truncate few-seeded ancestor in Peritoma.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first phylogenetic hypotheses for the 20 species of Cistus based on plastid (trnL-trnF, matK) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequence data. Phylogenetic relationships reveal that: (1) Halimium and Cistus form a cohesive, natural group; (2) two major lineages of purple-flowered and white-flowered species are defined, except for the purple-flowered C. parviflorus; (3) monophyly of conspecific populations is congruent with the circumscription of species. Topological congruence between nuclear and plastid phylogenies does not support a predominant reticulate system of evolution in Cistus. Reconstruction of character evolution suggests an increment of number of fruit valves in the Cistaceae from 3 to 12 in a unidirectional manner. In contrast, reproductive characters, such as sepal number, petal color, and style length, evolved multiple times in the course of evolution. A single colonization of Cistus into the Canary Islands appears to be responsible for a lineage of four species sharing a most recent common ancestor with five sepals, purple flowers, styles as long as stamens, and five fruit valves. Species diversity in Cistus (14) and Halimium (8), coupled with sister-group relationships and molecular divergence, lead us to suggest the western Mediterranean as a major center of present-day differentiation, but paleobotanical data indicate an earlier formation of the Cistus-Halimium assemblage in different areas.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The complex geological and climatic history of the Neotropics has had major implications on the diversification of plant lineages. Chrysobalanaceae is a pantropical family of trees and shrubs with 75\% of its 531 species found in the Neotropics, and a time-calibrated phylogeny of this family should shed light on the tempo of diversification in the Neotropical flora. Previously published phylogenetic hypotheses of this family were poorly supported, and its biogeography remains unclear. METHODS We assembled the complete plastid genome of 51 Chrysobalanaceae species, and increased taxon sampling by Sanger-sequencing of five plastid regions for an additional 88 species. We generated a time-calibrated tree including all 139 Chrsyobalanaceae species and 23 outgroups. We then conducted an ancestral area reconstruction analysis and estimated diversification rates in the family. KEY RESULTS The tree generated with the plastid genome alignment was almost fully resolved. It supports the polyphyly of Licania and Hirtella. The family has diversified starting around the Eocene-Oligocene transition. An ancestral area reconstruction confirms a Paleotropical origin for Chrysobalanaceae with several transoceanic dispersal events. The main Neotropical clade likely resulted from a single migration event from Africa around 28 mya ago, which subsequently underwent rapid diversification. CONCLUSIONS Given the diverse ecologies exhibited by extant species, we hypothesize that the rapid diversification of Chrysobalanaceae following the colonization of the Neotropics was triggered by habitat specialization during the complex geological and paleoclimatic history of the Neotropics.},

Within Clade A, two subclades, corresponding to Solms-Laubach's sections Triandri and Brachyuri, can be recognized. Solms-Laubach's subgenera Fruticosi and Herbacei, however, were resolved as paraphyletic, and thus the traditional division of Chloranthus on the basis of growth habit was not supported. Evidence from ITS and trnL-F sequences, in agreement with morphology, anatomy, and cytology, strongly suggest that Chloranthus consists of two groups that morphologically may be distinguished by their androecial characters. The present study also supports the hypothesis that the tripartite androecium of Chloranthus may have arisen by splitting of a single stamen with two marginal thecae.},

	doi = {10.1093/sysbio/syr062},
	abstract = {Chloranthaceae is a small family of flowering plants (65 species) with an extensive fossil record extending back to the Early Cretaceous. Within Chloranthaceae, Hedyosmum is remarkable because of its disjunct distribution--1 species in the Paleotropics and 44 confined to the Neotropics--and a long "temporal gap" between its stem age (Early Cretaceous) and the beginning of the extant radiation (late Cenozoic). Is this gap real, reflecting low diversification and a recent radiation, or the signature of extinction? Here we use paleontological data, relaxed-clock molecular dating, diversification analyses, and parametric ancestral area reconstruction to investigate the timing, tempo, and mode of diversification in Hedyosmum. Our results, based on analyses of plastid and nuclear sequences for 40 species, suggest that the ancestor of Chloranthaceae and the Hedyosmum stem lineages were widespread in the Holarctic in the Late Cretaceous. High extinction rates, possibly associated with Cenozoic climatic fluctuations, may have been responsible for the low extant diversity of the family. Crown group Hedyosmum originated c. 36-43 Ma and colonized South America from the north during the Early-Middle Miocene (c. 20 Ma). This coincided with an increase in diversification rates, probably triggered by the uplift of the Northern Andes from the Mid-Miocene onward. This study illustrates the advantages of combining paleontological, phylogenetic, and biogeographic data to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of an ancient lineage, for which the extant diversity is only a remnant of past radiations. It also shows the difficulties of inferring patterns of lineage diversification when incomplete taxon sampling is combined with high extinction rates.},

Data on Centrolepidaceae are important for comparison with other Poales, including grasses and sedges.• METHODS We examined vegetative and reproductive morphology in a global survey of Centrolepidaceae based on light and scanning electron microscopy of 18 species, representing all three genera. We used these data to perform a cladistic analysis to assess character evolution.• KEY RESULTS Each of the three genera is monophyletic; Centrolepis is sister to Aphelia. Some Centrolepidaceae show a change from spiral to distichous phyllotaxy on inflorescence transition. In Aphelia and most species of Centrolepis, several morphologically distinct leaf types develop along the primary shoot axis and flowers are confined to dorsiventral lateral spikelets. Centrolepis racemosa displays secondary unification of programs of leaf development, absence of the leaf hyperphyll and loss of shoot dimorphism. Presence or absence of a leaf ligule and features of inflorescence and flower morphology are useful as phylogenetic characters in Centrolepidaceae.• CONCLUSIONS Ontogenetic changes in phyllotaxy differ fundamentally between some Centrolepidaceae and many grasses. Inferred evolutionary transformations of phyllotaxy in Centrolepidaceae inflorescences also differ from those in grasses. In contrast with grasses, some Centrolepidaceae possess ligulate leaves where the ligule represents the boundary between the bifacial hypophyll and unifacial hyperphyll. All the highly unusual features of the morphological-misfit species Centrolepis racemosa could result from the same saltational event. Centrolepidaceae offer good perspectives for studies of evolutionary developmental biology.},

Euonymus is the most diverse (129 species) and widely cultivated genus in the tribe. We infer that tribe Euonymeae consists of at least six separate lineages within Celastraceae and that a revised natural classification of the family is needed. Microtropis and Quetzalia are inferred to be distinct sister groups that together are sister to Zinowiewia. The endangered Monimopetalum chinense is an isolated and early derived lineage of Celastraceae that represents an important component of phylogenetic diversity within the family. Hedraianthera is sister to Brassiantha, and we describe a second species (Brassiantha hedraiantheroides A.J. Ford) that represents the first reported occurrence of this genus in Australia. Euonymus globularis, from eastern Australia, is sister to Menepetalum, which is endemic to New Caledonia, and we erect a new genus (Dinghoua R.H. Archer) for it. The Madagascan species of Euonymus are sister to Pleurostylia and recognized as a distinct genus (Astrocassine ined.).

Our results show that Celastrus, together with Tripterygium, formed a maximal supported clade. Within the cluster, Celastrus is composed of a basal clade and a core Celastrus clade, and the latter is consisted of six subclades. Relationships among species are more influenced by latitude than continental distribution patterns. The cauline cyme and lunate seeds are distinct characters to one of the maximal supported subclades. Their close relationship, similar geographical pattern and habitat imply that C. flagellaris may be a potential invasive species threatening C. scandens in North America. Celastrus leiocarpus, C. oblanceifolius and C. rugosus are confirmed as synonyms of C. punctatus, C. aculeatus and C. glaucophyllus, respectively.

The subfamily is easily recognized by the synapomorphies of transversely flattened, deeply lobed capsules and seeds with membranous basal wings or narrow stipes together with bisexual, 5-merous flowers that generally have an extrastaminal disk and three stamens. Hippocrateoideae, like Salacioideae, are inferred to have an Old World origin. The narrow stipes of Neotropical species that are water-dispersed are inferred to be derived within the subfamily from ancestral species with wind-dispersed winged seeds. Helictonema, a monotypic genus endemic to tropical Africa, has a small, white, spongy aril that is located at the base of the seed wing and appears to be unique within Hippocrateoideae. Our inference that Helictonema is sister to the remaining members of the subfamily, considered in the context of Sarawakodendron being sister to Salacioideae, suggests that small arils and capsular fruit were primitive within both subfamilies. The aril became dramatically enlarged within Salacioideae, in which the fruits are berries, and lost entirely within Hippocrateoideae, in which the fruits are transversely flattened capsules. All five Old World taxa of Prionostemma and all eight currently recognized species within Simirestis are transferred to Pristimera, one South African variety of Pristimera is raised to species level, and all three taxa in Pristimera subgenus Trochantha are transferred to the new genus Trochantha.},

In this study we conducted the most thorough phylogenetic analysis of Celastraceae yet completed with respect to both character and taxon sampling, and include representatives of five new endemic genera. Fifty-one new accessions, together with 328 previously used accessions of Celastrales, were sampled for morphological characters, two rDNA gene regions, and two plastid gene regions. The endemic Malagasy genera are resolved in two separate lineages-Xenodrys by itself and all other endemic genera in a clade that also includes four lineages inferred to have dispersed from Madagascar: Brexia madagascariensis (Mascarene Islands, coastal Africa), Elaeodendron (West Indies, Africa to New Caledonia), and Pleurostylia (Africa to New Caledonia). Of the 12 extant Malagasy Celastraceae lineages identified, eight are clearly of African origin. The origins of the remaining four lineages are less clear, but reasonable possibilities include America, Eurasia, Africa, southern India, Malesia, and Australia. Based on 95\% credible age intervals from fossil-calibrated molecular dating, all 12 extant Malagasy Celastraceae lineages appear to have arisen following dispersal after the separation of Madagascar from other landmasses within the last 70 million years.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY Phylogenetic relationships were investigated among the eight families (Anacampserotaceae, Basellaceae, Cactaceae, Didiereaceae, Halophytaceae, Montiaceae, Portulacaceae, Talinaceae) that form suborder Cactineae (= Portulacineae) of the Caryophyllales. In addition, photosynthesis diversification and historical biogeography were addressed. • METHODS Chloroplast DNA sequences, mostly noncoding, were used to estimate the phylogeny. Divergence times were calibrated using two Hawaiian Portulaca species, due to the lack of an unequivocal fossil record for Cactineae. Photosynthetic pathways were determined from carbon isotope ratios (δ(13)C) and leaf anatomy. • KEY RESULTS Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses were consistent with previous studies in that the suborder, almost all families, and the ACPT clade (Anacampserotaceae, Cactaceae, Portulacaceae, Talinaceae) were strongly supported as monophyletic; however, relationships among families remain uncertain. The age of Cactineae was estimated to be 18.8 Myr. Leaf anatomy and δ(13)C and were congruent in most cases, and inconsistencies between these pointed to photosynthetic intermediates. Reconstruction of photosynthesis diversification showed C(3) to be the ancestral pathway, a shift to C(4) in Portulacaceae, and five independent origins of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). Cactineae were inferred to have originated in the New World. • CONCLUSIONS Although the C(3) pathway is inferred as the ancestral state in Cactineae, some CAM activity has been reported in the literature in almost every family of the suborder, leaving open the possibility that CAM may have one origin in the group. Incongruence among loci could be due to internal short branches, which possibly represent rapid radiations in response to increasing aridity in the Miocene.},

The genes targeted for sequencing are typically single-copy loci, which facilitate a more straightforward sequence assembly and homology assignment process. However, this approach limits the inclusion of most genes of functional interest, which often belong to multi-gene families. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of including large gene families in hybrid enrichment protocols for phylogeny reconstruction and subsequent analyses of molecular evolution, using a new set of bait sequences designed for the "portullugo" (Caryophyllales), a moderately sized lineage of flowering plants ({\textasciitilde} 2200 species) that includes the cacti and harbors many evolutionary transitions to C\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{4\}\}\$ and CAM photosynthesis. Including multi-gene families allowed us to simultaneously infer a robust phylogeny and construct a dense sampling of sequences for a major enzyme of C\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{4\}\}\$ and CAM photosynthesis, which revealed the accumulation of adaptive amino acid substitutions associated with C\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{4\}\}\$ and CAM origins in particular paralogs. Our final set of matrices for phylogenetic analyses included 75-218 loci across 74 taxa, with {\textasciitilde} 50\% matrix completeness across data sets. Phylogenetic resolution was greatly improved across the tree, at both shallow and deep levels. Concatenation and coalescent-based approaches both resolve the sister lineage of the cacti with strong support: Anacampserotaceae \$+\$ Portulacaceae, two lineages of mostly diminutive succulent herbs of warm, arid regions. In spite of this congruence, BUCKy concordance analyses demonstrated strong and conflicting signals across gene trees. Our results add to the growing number of examples illustrating the complexity of phylogenetic signals in genomic-scale data.},

	abstract = {Betalain pigments are unique to the Caryophyllales and structurally and biosynthetically distinct from anthocyanins. Two key enzymes within the betalain synthesis pathway have been identified: 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) that catalyzes the formation of betalamic acid and CYP76AD1, a cytochrome P450 gene that catalyzes the formation of cyclo-DOPA. We performed phylogenetic analyses to reveal the evolutionary history of the DODA and CYP76AD1 lineages and in the context of an ancestral reconstruction of pigment states we explored the evolution of these genes in relation to the complex evolution of pigments in Caryophylalles. Duplications within the CYP76AD1 and DODA lineages arose just before the origin of betalain pigmentation in the core Caryophyllales. The duplications gave rise to DODA-α and CYP76AD1-α isoforms that appear specific to betalain synthesis. Both betalain-specific isoforms were then lost or downregulated in the anthocyanic Molluginaceae and Caryophyllaceae. Our findings suggest a single origin of the betalain synthesis pathway, with neofunctionalization following gene duplications in the CYP76AD1 and DODA lineages. Loss of DODA-α and CYP76AD1-α in anthocyanic taxa suggests that betalain pigmentation has been lost twice in Caryophyllales, and exclusion of betalain pigments from anthocyanic taxa is mediated through gene loss or downregulation.

Our study included the most thorough sampling to date: 2-5 individuals per species and 4 independent genetic partitions: eight plastid and three low-copy nuclear loci (9217bps), allowing a three-locus BEST species tree. Despite incomplete resolution at the tips, our results support monophyly for each extant species. Gene trees revealed several clear cases of cytonuclear incongruence, likely created by interspecific introgression. Conflict occurs at the divergence of section Alphaschiedea as well as at the tips. Ages inferred from a BEAST analysis allow an original colonization onto either Nihoa or Kauaì and inform some aspects of inter-island migrations. We suggest that several hard polytomies on the species tree are biologically realistic, signifying either nearly simultaneous speciation or historical introgressive hybridization. Based on inferred node ages that exceed expected coalescent times, we propose that undetected nuclear introgression may play a larger role than incomplete lineage sorting in sections Schiedea and Mononeura.},

	abstract = {In flowering plants, plastid genomes are generally conserved, exhibiting slower rates of sequence evolution than the nucleus and little or no change in structural organization. However, accelerated plastid genome evolution has occurred in scattered angiosperm lineages. For example, some species within the genus Silene have experienced a suite of recent changes to their plastid genomes, including inversions, shifts in inverted repeat boundaries, large indels, intron losses, and rapid rates of amino acid sequence evolution in a subset of protein genes, with the most extreme divergence occurring in the protease gene clpP. To investigate the relationship between the rates of sequence and structural evolution, we sequenced complete plastid genomes from three species (Silene conoidea, S. paradoxa, and Lychnis chalcedonica), representing independent lineages within the tribe Sileneae that were previously shown to have accelerated rates of clpP evolution. We found a high degree of parallel evolution. Elevated rates of amino acid substitution have occurred repeatedly in the same subset of plastid genes and have been accompanied by a recurring pattern of structural change, including cases of identical inversions and intron loss. This "syndrome" of changes was not observed in the closely related outgroup Agrostemma githago or in the more slowly evolving Silene species that were sequenced previously. Although no single mechanism has yet been identified to explain the correlated suite of changes in plastid genome sequence and structure that has occurred repeatedly in angiosperm evolution, we discuss a possible mixture of adaptive and non-adaptive forces that may be responsible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Recent phylogenetic studies have revealed that the mitochondrial genome of the angiosperm Silene noctiflora (Caryophyllaceae) has experienced a massive mutation-driven acceleration in substitution rate, placing it among the fastest evolving eukaryotic genomes ever identified. To date, it appears that other species within Silene have maintained more typical substitution rates, suggesting that the acceleration in S. noctiflora is a recent and isolated evolutionary event. This assessment, however, is based on a very limited sampling of taxa within this diverse genus. RESULTS We analyzed the substitution rates in 4 mitochondrial genes (atp1, atp9, cox3 and nad9) across a broad sample of 74 species within Silene and related genera in the tribe Sileneae. We found that S. noctiflora shares its history of elevated mitochondrial substitution rate with the closely related species S. turkestanica. Another section of the genus (Conoimorpha) has experienced an acceleration of comparable magnitude. The phylogenetic data remain ambiguous as to whether the accelerations in these two clades represent independent evolutionary events or a single ancestral change. Rate variation among genes was equally dramatic. Most of the genus exhibited elevated rates for atp9 such that the average tree-wide substitution rate for this gene approached the values for the fastest evolving branches in the other three genes. In addition, some species exhibited major accelerations in atp1 and/or cox3 with no correlated change in other genes. Rates of non-synonymous substitution did not increase proportionally with synonymous rates but instead remained low and relatively invariant. CONCLUSION The patterns of phylogenetic divergence within Sileneae suggest enormous variability in plant mitochondrial mutation rates and reveal a complex interaction of gene and species effects. The variation in rates across genomic and phylogenetic scales raises questions about the mechanisms responsible for the evolution of mutation rates in plant mitochondrial genomes.},

A total of 57 Cerastium taxa was analyzed using two species of the putative sister genus Stellaria as outgroups. Maximum parsimony analyses identified four clades that largely corresponded to previously recognized infrageneric groups. The results suggest an Old World origin and at least two migration events into North America from the Old World. The first event possibly took place across the Bering land bridge during the Miocene. Subsequent colonization of South America occurred after the North and South American continents joined during the Pliocene. A more recent migration event into North America probably across the northern Atlantic took place during the Quaternary, resulting in the current circumpolar distribution of the Arctic species. Molecular clock dating of major biogeographic events was internally consistent on the phylogenetic trees. The arctic high-polyploid species form a polytomy together with some boreal and temperate species of the C. tomentosum group and the C. arvense group. Lack of genetic variation among the arctic species probably indicates a recent origin. The annual life form is shown to be of polyphyletic origin.},

SlX1 and SlY1 are sex-linked genes on the sex chromosomes of dioecious members of Silene sect. Elisanthe. RESULTS We sequenced the homologues of the SlX1/Y1 genes in several Sileneae species. We demonstrate that different parts of the SlX1/Y1 region give different phylogenetic signals. The major discrepancy is that Silene vulgaris and S. sect. Conoimorpha (S. conica and relatives) exchange positions. To determine whether gene duplication followed by recombination (an intralineage process) may explain the phylogenetic conflict in the Silene SlX1/Y1 gene, we use a novel probabilistic, multiple primer-pair PCR approach. We did not find any evidence supporting gene duplication/loss as explanation to the phylogenetic conflict. CONCLUSION The phylogenetic conflict in the Silene SlX1/Y1 gene cannot be explained by paralogy or artefacts, such as in vitro recombination during PCR. The support for the conflict is strong enough to exclude methodological or stochastic errors as likely sources. Instead, the phylogenetic incongruence may have been caused by recombination of two divergent alleles following ancient interspecific hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting. These events probably took place several million years ago. This example clearly demonstrates that different parts of the genome may have different evolutionary histories and stresses the importance of using multiple genes in reconstruction of taxonomic relationships.},

Although the vast majority of North American Silene species are polyploid, which contrasts to the diploid condition dominating in other parts of the world, the phylogenetic analyses rejected a single origin of the North American polyploids. One lineage consists of tetraploid Silene menziesii and its diploid allies. A second lineage, Physolychnis s.l., consists of Arctic, European, Asian, and South American taxa in addition to the majority of the North American polyploids. The hexaploid S. hookeri is derived from an allopolyploidization between these two lineages. The tetraploid S. nivea does not belong to any of these lineages, but is closely related to the European diploid S. baccifera. The poor resolution within Physolychnis s.l. may be attributed to rapid radiation, recombination among homoeologues, homoplasy, or any combination of these factors. No extant diploid donors could be identified in Physolychnis s.l.},

We tested overall model congruence in a likelihood context using the software PLATO and found that ITSs, RPA2, and RPB2 deviated from the maximum likelihood model for the combined data. The topology parameter was then isolated and topological congruence assessed by nonparametric bootstrapping. No strong topological incongruence was found. The analysis of the combined data sets resolves previously poorly known major relationships within Sileneae. Two paralogues of RPD2 were found, and several independent losses and incomplete concerted evolution were inferred.

We used nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and intron sequences of the chloroplast gene rps16 to examine phylogenetic and biogeographical patterns within the genus Heliosperma (Sileneae, Caryophyllaceae). The ITS and rps16 intron sequences both support monophyly of Heliosperma, but the data are not conclusive with regard to its exact origin. Three strongly supported clades are found in both data sets, corresponding to Heliosperma alpestre, Heliosperma macranthum and the Heliosperma pusillum clade, including all other taxa. The interrelationships among these three differ between the nuclear and the plastid data sets. Hierarchical relationships within the H. pusillum clade are poorly resolved by the ITS data, but the rps16 intron sequences form two well-supported clades which are geographically, rather than taxonomically, correlated. A similar geographical structure is found in the ITS data, when analyzed with the NeighbourNet method. The apparent rate of change within Heliosperma is slightly higher for rps16 as compared to ITS. In contrast, in the Sileneae outgroup, ITS substitution rates are more than twice as high as those for rps16, a situation more in agreement with what has been found in other rate comparisons of noncoding cpDNA and ITS. Unlike most other Sileneae ITS sequences, the H. pusillum group sequences display extensive polymorphism. A possible explanation to these patterns is extensive hybridization and gene flow within Heliosperma, which together with concerted evolution may have eradicated the ancient divergence suggested by the rps16 data. The morphological differentiation into high elevation, mainly widely distributed taxa, and low elevation narrow endemics is not correlated with the molecular data, and is possibly a result of ecological differentiation.},

Relative dates of divergence times are used to discriminate between hybridization and gene duplication/loss as alternative explanations for topological conflicts between gene trees. The observed incongruent relationships among the three major lineages of Heliosperma are better explained by homoploid hybridization than by gene duplication/losses because species branching events exceed gene coalescence times under biologically reasonable population sizes and generation times, making lineage sorting an unlikely explanation. The origin of Heliosperma is complex and the gene trees likely reflect both reticulate evolution and sorting events. At least two lineages have been involved in the origin of Heliosperma, one most closely related to the ancestor of Viscaria and Atocion and the other to Eudianthe and/or Petrocoptis.},

To explore part of the morphological evolution within the family, we investigated the phylogeny of the Caryophyllaceae by means of analyzing plastid and nuclear sequence data with parsimony and Bayesian methods. We describe a mode of tracing a stable phylogenetic signal in ITS sequences, and a significant common signal is shared with the plastid data. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses yield some differences in tree resolution. None of the subfamilies appear monophyletic, but the monophyly of the Caryophylloideae is not contradicted. Alsinoideae are paraphyletic, with Arenaria subg. Eremogone and Minuartia subg. Spergella more closely related to the Caryophylloideae. There is strong support for the inclusion of Spergula-Spergularia in an Alsinoideae-Caryophylloideae clade. Putative synapomorphies for these groupings are twice as many stamens as number of sepals and a caryophyllad-type of embryogeny.

Poor resolution among closely related species are often explained by low levels of variation in chloroplast data, but the problem with our data appear to be high levels of homoplasy. Tree-like cpDNA evolution cannot be rejected, but apparent incongruent patterns between different regions are evaluated with the possibility of ancient interspecific chloroplast recombination as explanatory model. However, several major phylogenetic relationships, previously not recognized, are confidently resolved, e.g. the grouping of the two SW Anatolian taxa S. cryptoneura and S. sordida strongly disagrees with previous studies on nuclear DNA sequence data, and indicate a possible case of homoploid hybrid origin. The closely related S. atocioides and S. aegyptiaca form a sister group to Lychnis and the rest of Silene, thus suggesting that Silene may be paraphyletic, despite recent revisions based on molecular data.},

In comparison to 142 phylogenetically informative sites in the Sanger sequences the GBS sequences yielded 3363 phylogenetically informative sites after exclusion of apparently oversaturated SNPs. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, NeighborNet, SVDquartets and Astral-II analyses all resulted in phylogenetic trees (and networks) in which interspecific relationships were largely unresolved. After excluding incomplete lineage sorting, hybridisation and oversaturation of characters as possible causes for lack of phylogenetic resolution, we conclude that the polytomy obtained most likely represents a hard polytomy.

Our phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences from the ITS of the ribosomal DNA and three chloroplast fragments (matK, trnL-trnF, and psbA-trnH) included 29 taxa belonging to five genera: the neotropical genera Carica, Vasconcellea, Jarilla, and Jacaratia and the equatorial African genus Cylicomorpha. Having a relatively low mutation rate, matK, and trnL-trnF were used for estimating relationships at the generic level, while intrageneric evolution within Vasconcellea was studied with the more variable ITS and psbA-trnH sequences. Gaps, coded as binary characters, were added to the sequence alignments before performing Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood analyses. Monophyly of Caricaceae as well as phylogenetic distance between Carica and Vasconcellea species, previously belonging to the same genus, and monophyly of the resurrected genus Vasconcellea were emphasized. Within Vasconcellea, the largest genus of this family, two well-confirmed evolutionary lineages could be discerned: (1) V.xheilbornii, V. weberbaueri, V. stipulata, and V. parviflora and (2) a clade holding all other taxa of the genus. Incongruence between nuclear ITS and chloroplast psbA-trnH datasets, shown to be significantly caused by some taxa of the genus Vasconcellea, indicated that reticulate events in this genus might be more frequent than previously suspected. Moreover, intra-individual ITS sequence heterogeneity provided further evidence for the hybrid or introgressed origin of different taxa and one presumed hybrid belonging to this genus.},

Phenotypic plasticity and intercompatibility between several species are likely to confuse morphological delimitation of the taxa. Based on the results of our study, several specimens that could not be identified with the currently used identification key (1) could be attributed to a known taxon, which should be extended to include a higher range of morphological variability or (2) could be hypothesized to be of hybrid origin.

	abstract = {Papaya (Carica papaya) is a crop of great economic importance, and the species was among the first plants to have its genome sequenced. However, there has never been a complete species-level phylogeny for the Caricaceae, and the crop's closest relatives are therefore unknown. We investigated the evolution of the Caricaceae based on sequences from all species and genera, the monospecific Carica, African Cylicomorpha with two species, South American Jacaratia and Vasconcellea with together c. 28 species, and Mexican/Guatemalan Jarilla and Horovitzia with four species. Most Caricaceae are trees or shrubs; the species of Jarilla, however, are herbaceous. We generated a matrix of 4711 nuclear and plastid DNA characters and used maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analysis to infer species relationships, rooting trees on the Moringaceae. Divergence times were estimated under relaxed and strict molecular clocks, using different subsets of the data. Ancestral area reconstruction relied on a ML approach. The deepest split in the Caricaceae occurred during the Late Eocene, when the ancestor of the Neotropical clade arrived from Africa. In South America, major diversification events coincide with the Miocene northern Andean uplift and the initial phase of the tectonic collision between South America and Panama resulting in the Panamanian land bridge. Carica papaya is sister to Jarilla/Horovitzia, and all three diverged from South American Caricaceae in the Oligocene, 27 (22-33) Ma ago, coincident with the early stages of the formation of the Panamanian Isthmus. The discovery that C. papaya is closest to a clade of herbaceous or thin-stemmed species has implications for plant breeders who have so far tried to cross papaya only with woody highland papayas (Vasconcellea).},

	abstract = {Cardiopteris, a small herbaceous genus, had long been placed in its own family, Cardiopteridaceae. However, the family was recently broadly circumscribed to include more genera in Aquifoliales. To better understand the morphological relationships of the genus and the family, I studied the floral anatomy and development of Cardiopteris using C. quinqueloba. As has been previously described, flowers are 5-merous with a unilocular gynoecium. I confirmed that the gynoecium is bicarpellate, possessing two dissimilar styles. An analysis of the development, structure, and vasculature of the gynoecium showed that it is pseudomonomerous, consisting of one fertile adaxial carpel and one solid sterile abaxial carpel. The adaxial carpel forms a thin style with a capitate stigma, whereas the abaxial carpel has a thick style, which develops into a freshy fruit appendage. Comparisons with flowers of other genera (Citronella, Gonocaryum, and Leptaulus) of Cardiopteridaceae as well as the other families (Aquifoliaceae, Helwingiaceae, Phyllonomaceae, and Stemonuraceae) of Aquifoliales showed that the pseudomonomerous gynoecium is very likely a synapomorphy to support the sister-group relationship between Cardiopteridaceae and Stemonuraceae. Moreover, contrary to all previous descriptions, Cardiopteris flowers were found to have an annular nectariferous disk at the base of the gynoecium.},

	abstract = {Brassicales is a diverse order perhaps most famous because it houses Brassicaceae and, its premier member, Arabidopsis thaliana. This widely distributed and species-rich lineage has been overlooked as a promising system to investigate patterns of disjunct distributions and diversification rates. We analyzed plastid and mitochondrial sequence data from five gene regions ({\textgreater}8000bp) across 151 taxa to: (1) produce a chronogram for major lineages in Brassicales, including Brassicaceae and Arabidopsis, based on greater taxon sampling across the order and previously overlooked fossil evidence, (2) examine biogeographical ancestral range estimations and disjunct distributions in BioGeoBEARS, and (3) determine where shifts in species diversification occur using BAMM. The evolution and radiation of the Brassicales began 103Mya and was linked to a series of inter-continental vicariant, long-distance dispersal, and land bridge migration events. North America appears to be a significant area for early stem lineages in the order. Shifts to Australia then African are evident at nodes near the core Brassicales, which diverged 68.5Mya (HPD=75.6-62.0). This estimated age combined with fossil evidence, indicates that some New World clades embedded amongst Old World relatives (e.g., New World capparoids) are the result of different long distance dispersal events, whereas others may be best explained by land bridge migration (e.g., Forchhammeria). Based on these analyses, the Brassicaceae crown group diverged in Europe/Northern Africa in the Eocene, circa 43.4Mya (HPD=46.6-40.3) and Arabidopsis separated from close congeners circa 10.4Mya. These ages fall between divergent dates that were previously published, suggesting we are slowly converging on a robust age estimate for the family. Three significant shifts in species diversification are observed in the order: (1) 58Mya at the crown of Capparaceae, Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae, (2) 38Mya at the crown of Resedaceae+Stixis clade, and (3) 21Mya at the crown of the tribes Brassiceae and Sisymbrieae within Brassicaceae.},

To elucidate the relationship between Brassicaceae and Capparaceae as well as to address infrafamilial relationships within Capparaceae, we analyzed sequence variation for a large sampling, especially of Capparaceae, of these two families using two chloroplast regions, trnL-trnF and ndhF. Results of parsimony and likelihood analyses strongly support the monophyly of Brassicaceae plus Capparaceae, excluding Forchhammeria, which is clearly placed outside the Brassicaceae and Capparaceae clade and suggest the recognition of three primary clades-Capparaceae subfamily (subf.) Capparoideae, subf. Cleomoideae, and Brassicaceae. Capparaceae monophyly is strongly contradicted with Cleomoideae appearing as sister to Brassicaceae. Two traditionally recognized subfamilies of Capparaceae, Dipterygioideae and Podandrogynoideae, are embedded within Cleomoideae. Whereas habit and some fruit characteristics demarcate the three major clades, floral symmetry, stamen number, leaf type, and fruit type all show homoplasy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Zingiberales comprise a clade of eight tropical monocot families including approx. 2500 species and are hypothesized to have undergone an ancient, rapid radiation during the Cretaceous. Zingiberales display substantial variation in floral morphology, and several members are ecologically and economically important. Deep phylogenetic relationships among primary lineages of Zingiberales have proved difficult to resolve in previous studies, representing a key region of uncertainty in the monocot tree of life. METHODS Next-generation sequencing was used to construct complete plastid gene sets for nine taxa of Zingiberales, which were added to five previously sequenced sets in an attempt to resolve deep relationships among families in the order. Variation in taxon sampling, process partition inclusion and partition model parameters were examined to assess their effects on topology and support. KEY RESULTS Codon-based likelihood analysis identified a strongly supported clade of ((Cannaceae, Marantaceae), (Costaceae, Zingiberaceae)), sister to (Musaceae, (Lowiaceae, Strelitziaceae)), collectively sister to Heliconiaceae. However, the deepest divergences in this phylogenetic analysis comprised short branches with weak support. Additionally, manipulation of matrices resulted in differing deep topologies in an unpredictable fashion. Alternative topology testing allowed statistical rejection of some of the topologies. Saturation fails to explain observed topological uncertainty and low support at the base of Zingiberales. Evidence for conflict among the plastid data was based on a support metric that accounts for conflicting resampled topologies. CONCLUSIONS Many relationships were resolved with robust support, but the paucity of character information supporting the deepest nodes and the existence of conflict suggest that plastid coding regions are insufficient to resolve and support the earliest divergences among families of Zingiberales. Whole plastomes will continue to be highly useful in plant phylogenetics, but the current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that they may not provide enough character information for resolving ancient, rapid radiations.},

	abstract = {Canellales, a clade consisting of Winteraceae and Canellaceae, represent the smallest order of magnoliid angiosperms. The clade shows a broad distribution throughout the Southern Hemisphere, across a diverse range of dry to wet tropical forests. In contrast to their sister-group, Winteraceae, the phylogenetic relations and biogeography within Canellaceae remain poorly studied. Here we present the phylogenetic relationships of all currently recognized genera of Canellales with a special focus on the Old World Canellaceae using a combined dataset consisting of the chloroplast trnK-matK-trnK-psbA and the nuclear single copy gene mag1 (Maigo 1). Within Canellaceae we found high statistical support for the monophyly of Warburgia and Cinnamosma. However, we also found relationships that differ from previous studies. Cinnamodendron splitted into two clades, a South American clade and a second clade confined to the Antilles and adjacent areas. Cinnamodendron from the Antilles, as well as Capsicodendron, South American Cinnamodendron and Pleodendron were not monophyletic. Consequently, Capsicodendron should be included in the South American Cinnamodendron clade and the genus Pleodendron merged with the Cinnamodendron clade from the Antilles. We also found that Warburgia (restricted to mainland eastern Africa) together with the South American Cinnamodendron and Capsicodendron are sister to the Malagasy genus Cinnamosma. In addition to the unexpected geographical relationships, both biogeographic and molecular clock analyses suggest vicariance, extinction, and at least one intercontinental long-distance-dispersal event. Our dating result contrasts previous work on Winteraceae. Diversification of Winteraceae took place in the Paleocene, predating the Canellaceae diversification by 13 MA in the Eocene. The phylogenetic relationships for Canellaceae supported here offer a solid framework for a future taxonomic revision of the Canellaceae.},

Based on phylogenetic analysis using nuclear ribosomal ITS and four plastid markers (matK, rbcL, psbA-trnH and trnG-S), our results strongly support the monophyly of Cyananthus and its close relationship with the Codonopsis clade of the platycodonoids. Three major clades are supported, corresponding to the three sections of the genus, with sect. Cyananthus, which mainly occurs in the Himalayas, being a sister to the clade comprising the other two sections (sect. Stenolobi and sect. Annui) distributed primarily in the Hengduan Mountain region. We also observed that Cyananthus exhibits variation in its sexual system, possessing both hermaphroditic and gynodioecious species. Character evolution analyses using Mesquite suggest that gynodioecy evolved from hermaphroditism only once in sect. Stenolobi, but that there is a reversal in C. formosus. Molecular dating and biogeographic analysis with LAGRANGE support dispersal from the Himalayas to the Hengduan Mountains during the early evolution of Cyananthus. The extensive uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Hengduan Mountains played an important role in the subsequent diversification of the genus.},

Based on a comprehensive taxon sampling and analyses of nuclear and plastid sequence and AFLP fingerprint data, Phyteuma is confirmed as a monophyletic group sister to the monotypic Physoplexis, which is in line with their peculiar flower morphologies. Within Phyteuma two clades, largely corresponding to previously recognized sections, are consistently found. The traditional circumscription of taxonomic series is largely rejected. Whereas distinctness of the currently recognized species is mostly corroborated, some interspecific relationships remain ambiguous due to incongruences between nuclear and plastid data. Major forces for diversification and evolution of Phyteuma are descending dysploidy (i.e., a decrease in chromosome base number) as well as allopatric and ecological differentiation within the Alps, the genus' center of species diversity.},

To increase phylogenetic resolution among major groups (Wahlenbergieae-Campanuleae), new sequences from the rbcL region were added to the trnL-F dataset obtained in a previous study. These phylogenies were used to infer ancestral areas and divergence times in Campanula and related genera using a Bayesian approach to molecular dating and dispersal-vicariance analyses that takes into account phylogenetic uncertainty. The new phylogenetic analysis confirms Platycodoneae as the sister group of Wahlenbergieae-Campanuleae, the two last ones inter-graded into a well-supported clade. Biogeographic and dating analyses suggest that Western Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean have played a major role as centers of migration and diversification within the Campanula alliance, probably in relation to the intense orogenic activity that took place in this region during the Late Neogene, and that could have promoted isolation and allopatric speciation within lineages. Diversification rates within several Campanula lineages would have increased at the end of the Miocene, coinciding with the Messinian Stage. Strong selective pressures from climate changes and the expansion of mountainous regions during this period are suggested to explain the adaptation to drought, cold or disturbed environments observed in many Campanula species. Several independent long-distance dispersal events to North America are inferred within the Rapunculus clade, which seem to be related to high ploidy levels.},

This first phylogeny of Wahlenbergia was reconstructed using about 20\% of the 260 species in the genus based on the nuclear ribosomal ITS marker and the chloroplast trnL-F marker with samples from South Africa, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Wahlenbergia was confirmed to be non-monophyletic, though most of the species form a clade. Our tree topology and date estimates indicate that Wahlenbergia diverged in South Africa about 29.6 mya, then dispersed to Australasia about 4.8 mya, thus indicating the radiation of Wahlenbergia occurred relatively recently. Radiations occurred in both of these main centres; there are currently about 170 species in South Africa and 45 species and subspecies in Australasia. New Zealand species comprise two clades, both rooted within the Australasian clade. We thus propose two dispersals from Australia to New Zealand, one leading to a radiation of species with the rhizomatous herbaceous growth form ca. 1.6 mya, and the other leading to a radiation of species with the radicate growth form 0.7 mya. Dispersals from Australia to New Zealand match the expected direction, following the west wind drift and ocean currents. The herbaceous growth form was shown to be ancestral for the genus as a whole, and polyploidy has been a mechanism of the evolution of the genus in Australasia.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED • PREMISE OF THE STUDY The species-rich Neotropical genera Centropogon, Burmeistera, and Siphocampylus represent more than half of the ∼1200 species in the subfamily Lobelioideae (Campanulaceae). They exhibit remarkable morphological variation in floral morphology and habit. Limited taxon sampling and phylogenetic resolution, however, obscures our understanding of relationships between and within these genera and underscores our uncertainty of the systematic value of fruit type as a major diagnostic character.• METHODS We inferred a phylogeny from five plastid DNA regions (rpl32-trnL, ndhF-rpl32, rps16-trnK, trnG-trnG-trns, rbcL) using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference. Ancestral character reconstructions were applied to infer patterns of fruit evolution.• KEY RESULTS Our results demonstrate that the majority of species in the genera Centropogon, Burmeistera, and Siphocampylus together form a primarily mainland Neotropical clade, collectively termed the "centropogonids." Caribbean Siphocampylus, however, group with other Caribbean lobelioid species. We find high support for the monophyly of Burmeistera and the polyphyly of Centropogon and mainland Siphocampylus. The ancestral fruit type of the centropogonids is a capsule; berries have evolved independently multiple times.• CONCLUSIONS Our plastid phylogeny greatly improves the phylogenetic resolution within Neotropical Lobelioideae and highlights the need for taxonomic revisions in the subfamily. Inference of ancestral character states identifies a dynamic pattern of fruit evolution within the centropogonids, emphasizing the difficulty of diagnosing broad taxonomic groups on the basis of fruit type. Finally, we identify that the centropogonids, Lysipomia, and Lobelia section Tupa form a Pan-Andean radiation with broad habitat diversity. This clade is a prime candidate for investigations of Neotropical biogeography and morphological evolution.},

The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region from 18-26S nuclear rDNA and chloroplast DNA from the 3' trnK intron were sequenced from 14 representative species. Our data suggest that Heterotoma, as originally conceived, is a good evolutionary unit within Lobelia and that the presence of a nectar spur is an important morphological character that can be used in defining phylogenetic position. This study also suggests that morphological changes associated with hummingbird pollination have evolved more than once in the Mexican lobeliads, from small blue-flowered, insect-pollinated relatives.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Phylogenies based on molecular data are revealing that generalizations about complex morphological structures often obscure variation and developmental patterns important for understanding the evolution of forms, as is the case for inflorescence morphology within the well-supported MGCA clade (Menyanthaceae + Goodeniaceae + Calyceraceae + Asteraceae). While the basal families share a basic thyrsic/thyrsoid structure of their inflorescences, Asteraceae possesses a capitulum that is widely interpreted as a racemose, condensed inflorescence. Elucidating the poorly known inflorescence structure of Calyceraceae, sister to Asteraceae, should help clarify how the Asteraceae capitulum evolved from thyrsic/thyrsoid inflorescences. METHODS The early development and structure of the inflorescence of eight species (five genera) of Calyceraceae were studied by SEM, and patterns of evolutionary change were interpreted via phylogenetic character mapping. KEY RESULTS The basic inflorescence structure of Calyceraceae is a cephalioid (a very condensed botryoid/thyrsoid). Optimization of inflorescence characters on a DNA sequence-derived tree suggests that the Asteraceae capitulum derives from a simple cephalioid through two morphological changes: loss of the terminal flower and suppression of the cymose branching pattern in the peripheral branches. CONCLUSIONS Widely understood as a condensed raceme, the Asteraceae capitulum is the evolutionary result of a very reduced, condensed thyrsoid. Starting from that point, evolution worked separately only on the racemose developmental control/pattern within Asteraceae and mainly on the cymose developmental control/pattern within Calyceraceae, producing head-like inflorescences in both groups but with very different diversification potential. We also discuss possible remnants of the ancestral cephalioid structure in some Asteraceae.},

Relationships within Calycanthus were difficult to resolve, but a shared 155-bp deletion in the trnL-F intergenic spacer unites the two North American species, which were also sisters in a cpDNA restriction site study. Their ancestor apparently crossed the Bering land bridge in the Miocene. The six species of Chimonanthus, by contrast, diverged from each other as recently as 1-2my ago, and a DIVA analysis with four areas of endemism recognized within China suggests three vicariance and two dispersal events within Chimonanthus, with initial vicariance having occurred between eastern and southwestern or central China.

	abstract = {Biogeographical patterns and diversification processes in Andean and Patagonian flora are not yet well understood. Calceolaria is a highly diversified genus of these areas, representing one of the most specialized plant-pollinator systems because flowers produce nonvolatile oils, a very unusual floral reward. Phylogenetic analyses with molecular (ITS and matK) and morphological characters from 103 Calceolaria species were conducted to examine relationships, to understand biogeographic patterns, and to detect evolutionary patterns of floral and ecological characters. Total evidence analysis retrieved three major clades, which strongly correspond to the three previously recognized subgenera, although only subgenus Rosula was retrieved as a monophyletic group. A single historical event explains the expansion from the southern to central Andes, while different parallel evolutionary lines show a northward expansion from the central to northern Andes across the Huancabamba Deflection, an important geographical barrier in northern Peru. Polyploidy, acquisition of elaiophores, and a nototribic pollination mechanism are key aspects of the evolutionary history of Calceolaria. Pollination interactions were more frequently established with Centris than with Chalepogenus oil-collecting bee species. The repeated loss of the oil gland and shifts to pollen as the only reward suggest an evolutionary tendency from highly to moderately specialized pollination systems.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY In its current circumscription, Echinopsis with 100-150 species is one of the largest and morphologically most diverse genera of Cactaceae. This diversity and an absence of correlated characters have resulted in numerous attempts to subdivide Echinopsis into more homogeneous subgroups. To infer natural species groups in this alliance, we here provide a plastid phylogeny and use it to infer changes in growth form, pollination mode, and ploidy level. METHODS We sequenced 3800 nucleotides of chloroplast DNA from 162 plants representing 144 species and subspecies. The sample includes the type species of all genera close to, or included in, Echinopsis as well as a dense sample of other genera of the Trichocereeae and further outgroups. New and published chromosome counts were compiled and traced on the phylogeny, as were pollination modes and growth habits. KEY RESULTS A maximum likelihood phylogeny confirms that Echinopsis s.l. is not monophyletic nor are any of the previously recognized genera that have more than one species. Pollination mode and, to a lesser extent, growth habit are evolutionarily labile, and diploidy is the rule in Echinopsis s.l., with the few polyploids clustered in just a few clades. CONCLUSIONS The use of evolutionary labile floral traits and growth habit has led to nonnatural classifications. Taxonomic realignments are required, but further study of less evolutionary labile traits suitable for circumscribing genera are needed. Surprisingly, polyploidy seems infrequent in the Echinopsis alliance and hybridization may thus be of minor relevance in the evolution of this clade.},

They exhibit a range of life forms from geophytes and cushion-plants to dwarf shrubs, shrubs or small trees. To confirm or challenge previous morphology-based classifications and molecular phylogenies, we sampled DNA sequences from the chloroplast trnK/matK region and the nuclear low copy gene phyC and compared the resulting phylogenies with previous data gathered from nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences. The here presented chloroplast and nuclear low copy gene phylogenies were mutually congruent and broadly coincident with the classification based on gross morphology and seed micro-morphology and anatomy. Reconstruction of hypothetical ancestral character states suggested that geophytes and cushion-forming species probably evolved several times from dwarf shrubby precursors. We also traced an increase of embryo size at the expense of the nucellus-derived storage tissue during the evolution of the Tephrocacteae, which is thought to be an evolutionary advantage because nutrients are then more rapidly accessible for the germinating embryo. In contrast to these highly concordant phylogenies, nuclear ribosomal DNA data sampled by a previous study yielded conflicting phylogenetic signals. Secondary structure predictions of ribosomal transcribed spacers suggested that this phylogeny is strongly influenced by the inclusion of paralogous sequence probably arisen by genome duplication during the evolution of this plant group.},

We found that the clade of cephalia-bearing cacti with naked pericarpels is centered in northeastern Brazil, whereas almost all other clades comprise Andean species. The spatial split between the clades was probably caused by the Andean uplift and the concurrent formation of intracontinental marine basins in the Tertiary. The phylogenetic reconstructions based on parsimony and Bayesian approaches do not reflect the traditional delimitation of the tribes and of the large genera. Our results suggest that Rebutia s.l. and Echinopsis s.l. are not monophyletic and that Sulcorebutia, Weingartia, and Cintia should be united into one genus.

In order to improve resolution in three major groups of Cactoideae, trnL-trnF sequences from members of these clades were added to a combined analysis. The three exemplars of Pereskia did not form a monophyletic group but a basal grade. The well-supported subfamilies Cactoideae and Opuntioideae and the genus Maihuenia formed a weakly supported clade sister to Pereskia. The parsimony analysis supported a sister group relationship of Maihuenia and Opuntioideae, although the likelihood analysis did not. Blossfeldia, a monotypic genus of morphologically modified and ecologically specialized cacti, was identified as the sister group to all other Cactoideae. The tribe Cacteae was found to be sister to a largely unresolved clade comprising the genera Calymmanthium, Copiapoa, and Frailea, as well as two large and well-supported clades. Browningia sensu stricto (excluding Castellanosia), the two tribes Cereeae and Trichocereeae, and parts of the tribes Notocacteae and Rhipsalideae formed one clade.

The other clade consists of the columnar cacti of Notocacteae, various genera of Browningieae, Echinocereeae, and Leptocereeae, the tribes Hylocereeae and Pachycereeae, and Pfeiffera.

Evolutionary relationships in these stem succulents have been insufficiently studied; thus, delimitation of Opuntia s.s. and major subclades, as well as the biogeographic history of this enigmatic group, remain unresolved. METHODS We sequenced the plastid intergenic spacers atpB-rbcL, ndhF-rpl32, psbJ-petA, and trnL-trnF, the plastid genes matK and ycf1, the nuclear gene ppc, and ITS to reconstruct the phylogeny of tribe Opuntieae, including Opuntia s.s. We used phylogenetic hypotheses to infer the biogeographic history, divergence times, and potential reticulate evolution of Opuntieae. KEY RESULTS Within Opuntieae, a clade of Tacinga, Opuntia lilae, Brasiliopuntia, and O. schickendantzii is sister to a well-supported Opuntia s.s., which includes Nopalea. Opuntia s.s. originated in southwestern South America (SA) and then expanded to the Central Andean Valleys and the desert region of western North America (NA). Two major clades evolved in NA, which subsequently diversified into eight subclades. These expanded north to Canada and south to Central America and the Caribbean, eventually returning back to SA primarily via allopolyploid taxa. Dating approaches suggest that most of the major subclades in Opuntia s.s. originated during the Pliocene. CONCLUSIONS Opuntia s.s. is a well-supported clade that includes Nopalea. The clade originated in southwestern SA, but the NA radiation was the most extensive, resulting in broad morphological diversity and frequent species formation through reticulate evolution and polyploidy.},

Many species are threatened with extinction. Despite being icons of the Atacama Desert and well loved by cactus enthusiasts, the evolution and diversity of Copiapoa has not yet been studied using a molecular approach. METHODS Sequence data of three plastid DNA markers (rpl32-trnL, trnH-psbA, ycf1) of 39 Copiapoa taxa were analyzed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference approaches. Species distributions were modeled based on geo-referenced localities and climatic data. Evolution of character states of four characters (root morphology, stem branching, stem shape, and stem diameter) as well as ancestral areas were reconstructed using a Bayesian and maximum likelihood framework, respectively. KEY RESULTS Clades of species are revealed. Though 32 morphologically defined species can be recognized, genetic diversity between some species and infraspecific taxa is too low to delimit their boundaries using plastid DNA markers. Recovered relationships are often supported by morphological and biogeographical patterns. The origin of Copiapoa likely lies between southern Peru and the extreme north of Chile. The Copiapó Valley limited colonization between two biogeographical areas. CONCLUSIONS Copiapoa is here defined to include 32 species and five heterotypic subspecies. Thirty species are classified into four sections and two subsections, while two species remain unplaced. A better understanding of evolution and diversity of Copiapoa will allow allocating conservation resources to the most threatened lineages and focusing conservation action on real biodiversity.},

Still, taxonomic units and species limits have been difficult to define, and molecular phylogenetic studies so far have yielded largely unresolved trees, so relationships within Cactaceae remain insufficiently understood. This study focuses on the predominantly epiphytic tribe Rhipsalideae and evaluates the utility of a spectrum of plastid genomic regions. • METHODS We present a phylogenetic study including 52 of the 53 Rhipsalideae species and all the infraspecific taxa. Seven regions (trnK intron, matK, rbcL, rps3-rpl16, rpl16 intron, psbA-trnH, trnQ-rps16), ca. 5600 nucleotides (nt) were sequenced per sample. The regions used were evaluated for their phylogenetic performance and performance in DNA-based species recognition based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined beforehand. • KEY RESULTS The Rhipsalideae are monophyletic and contain five clades that correspond to the genera Rhipsalis, Lepismium, Schlumbergera, Hatiora, and Rhipsalidopsis. The species-level tree was well resolved and supported; the rpl16 and trnK introns yielded the best phylogenetic signal. Although the psbA-trnH and trnQ-rps16 spacers were the most successful individual regions for OTU identification, their success rate did not significantly exceed 70\%. The highest OTU identification rate of 97\% was found using the combination of psbA-trnH, rps3-rpl16, trnK intron, and trnQ-rps16 as a minimum possible marker length (ca. 1660 nt). • CONCLUSIONS The phylogenetic performance of a marker is not determined by the level of sequence variability, and species discrimination power does not necessarily correlate with phylogenetic utility.},

Although cacti are conspicuous elements of arid ecosystems in the New World and are model systems for ecological and anatomical studies, the high morphological convergence and scarcity of phenotypic synapomorphies make the evolutionary relationships and trends among lineages difficult to understand. METHODS We performed phylogenetic analyses implementing parsimony ratchet and likelihood methods, using a concatenated matrix with 6148 bp of plastid and nuclear markers (trnK/matK, matK, trnL-trnF, rpl16, and ppc). We included 224 species representing approximately 85\% of the family's genera. Likelihood methods were used to perform an ancestral character reconstruction within Cactoideae, the richest subfamily in terms of morphological diversity and species number, to evaluate possible growth form evolutionary trends. KEY RESULTS Our phylogenetic results support previous studies showing the paraphyly of subfamily Pereskioideae and the monophyly of subfamilies Opuntioideae and Cactoideae. After the early divergence of Blossfeldia, Cactoideae splits into two clades: Cacteae, including North American globose and barrel-shaped members, and core Cactoideae, including the largest diversity of growth forms distributed throughout the American continent. Para- or polyphyly is persistent in different parts of the phylogeny. Main Cactoideae clades were found to have different ancestral growth forms, and convergence toward globose, arborescent, or columnar forms occurred in different lineages.

	abstract = {The cacti are well-known desert plants, widely recognized by their specialized growth form and essentially leafless condition. Pereskia, a group of 17 species with regular leaf development and function, is generally viewed as representing the "ancestral cactus," although its placement within Cactaceae has remained uncertain. Here we present a new hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships at the base of the Cactaceae, inferred from DNA sequence data from five gene regions representing all three plant genomes. Our data support a basal split in Cactaceae between a clade of eight Pereskia species, centered around the Caribbean basin, and all other cacti. Two other Pereskia clades, distributed mostly in the southern half of South America, are part of a major clade comprising Maihuenia plus Cactoideae, and Opuntioideae. This result highlights several events in the early evolution of the cacti. First, during the transition to stem-based photosynthesis, the evolution of stem stomata and delayed bark formation preceded the evolution of the stem cortex into a specialized photosynthetic tissue system. Second, the basal split in cacti separates a northern from an initially southern cactus clade, and the major cactus lineages probably originated in southern or west-central South America.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The South American genus Gymnocalycium (Cactoideae-Trichocereae) demonstrates how the sole use of morphological data in Cactaceae results in conflicts in assessing phylogeny, constructing a taxonomic system, and analyzing trends in the evolution of the genus. METHODS Molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed using parsimony and Bayesian methods on a 6195-bp data matrix of plastid DNA sequences (atpI-atpH, petL-psbE, trnK-matK, trnT-trnL-trnF) of 78 samples, including 52 species and infraspecific taxa representing all the subgenera of Gymnocalycium. We assessed morphological character evolution using likelihood methods to optimize characters on a Bayesian tree and to reconstruct possible ancestral states. KEY RESULTS The results of the phylogenetic study confirm the monophyly of the genus, while supporting overall the available infrageneric classification based on seed morphology. Analysis showed the subgenera Microsemineum and Macrosemineum to be polyphyletic and paraphyletic. Analysis of morphological characters showed a tendency toward reduction of stem size, reduction in quantity and hardiness of spines, increment of seed size, development of napiform roots, and change from juicy and colorful fruits to dry and green fruits. CONCLUSIONS Gymnocalycium saglionis is the only species of Microsemineum and a new name is required to identify the clade including the remaining species of Microsemineum; we propose the name Scabrosemineum in agreement with seed morphology. Identifying morphological trends and environmental features allows for a better understanding of the events that might have influenced the diversification of the genus.},

	abstract = {Tribe Rhipsalideae is composed of unusual epiphytic or lithophytic cacti that inhabit humid tropical and subtropical forests. Members of this tribe present a reduced vegetative body, a specialized adventitious root system, usually spineless areoles and flowers and fruits reduced in size. Despite the debate surrounding the classification of Rhipsalideae, no studies have ever attempted to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among its members or to test the monophyly of its genera using DNA sequence data; all classifications formerly proposed for this tribe have only employed morphological data. In this study, we reconstruct the phylogeny of Rhipsalideae using plastid (trnQ-rps16, rpl32-trnL, psbA-trnH) and nuclear (ITS) markers to evaluate the classifications previously proposed for the group. We also examine morphological features traditionally used to delimit genera within Rhipsalideae in light of the resulting phylogenetic trees. In total new sequences for 35 species of Rhipsalideae were produced (out of 55; 63\%). The molecular phylogeny obtained comprises four main clades supporting the recognition of genera Lepismium, Rhipsalis, Hatiora and Schlumbergera. The evidence gathered indicate that a broader genus Schlumbergera, including Hatiora subg. Rhipsalidopsis, should be recognized. Consistent morphological characters rather than homoplastic features are used in order to establish a more coherent and practical classification for the group. Nomenclatural changes and a key for the identification of the genera currently included in Rhipsalideae are provided.},

There is doubt as to whether the genus is monophyletic, and past infrageneric treatments differ regarding generic circumscription. Phylogenetic questions about Mammillaria were addressed using chloroplast DNA sequence data from the rpl16 intron and the psbA-trnH intergenic spacer for 125 taxa (113 Mammillaria, 10 Coryphantha, Escobaria, Neolloydia, Pelecyphora, Ortegocactus, and two outgroup taxa from Ferocactus and Stenocactus). Parsimony analyses were conducted using various heuristic search strategies. Bayesian analyses were conducted using the F81 and F81 + I + G models of sequence evolution. Tree topologies from the parsimony and Bayesian analyses were largely congruent. Hypothesis testing was undertaken using the parametric bootstrap to test the monophyly of the genus and the taxonomic status of Mammillaria candida. Phylogenies derived from the parsimony and Bayesian analyses indicate that Mammillaria is not monophyletic and that the genus Mammilloydia (synonym Mammillaria) is embedded within a "core" group of Mammillaria species. Both these results were corroborated by the parametric bootstrap tests. The entire rpl16 intron was deleted from species in the Mammillaria crinita group.},

This study was the first to compare adequately sampled morphological and DNA analyses at the population level in the Cactaceae. This comparison was important to test reliability of both methods and to gain a better understanding of phytogeography, evolution, and systematics of the species, knowledge that could prove useful for other taxa as well. Populations of C. robustispina subsp. robustispina are listed as endangered by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Our primary goal was to explore correlations among geographical distribution, morphology, and genetics of selected populations throughout the range of the species and the outgroup, C. poselgeriana. • METHODS Stem characters were measured for 638 individuals among 16 populations. Flower characters were measured for 180 individuals among 12 populations. Ten microsatellite DNA loci were isolated and characterized for 204 individuals among 13 populations. Data were analyzed using various multivariate analyses. • RESULTS Our results indicated that, within Coryphantha robustispina, there were three morphologically, genetically, and geographically coherent groups represented by the names C. robustispina subsp. robustispina, C. robustispina subsp. uncinata, and C. robustispina subsp. scheeri. For most analyses, distinctions among the three groups were primarily not as great as those between any one of them and the outgroup. • CONCLUSIONS Results suggested that the three subspecific taxa within Coryphantha robustispina are good subspecies but should not be elevated to species rank. The closely aligned results between morphology and microsatellite data support the design and utility of both methods.},

The plastid rpl16 and trnL-F regions were sequenced for 98 taxa including 17 species of Peniocereus, representatives from all genera of tribe Pachycereeae, four genera of tribe Hylocereeae, as well as from three additional outgroup genera of tribes Calymmantheae, Notocacteae, and Trichocereeae. Phylogenetic analyses support neither the monophyly of Peniocereus as currently circumscribed, nor the monophyly of tribe Pachycereeae since species of Peniocereus subgenus Pseudoacanthocereus are embedded within tribe Hylocereeae. Furthermore, these results show that the eight species of Peniocereus subgenus Peniocereus (Peniocereus sensu stricto) form a well-supported clade within subtribe Pachycereinae; P. serpentinus is also a member of this subtribe, but is sister to Bergerocactus. Moreover, Nyctocereus should be resurrected as a monotypic genus. Species of Peniocereus subgenus Pseudoacanthocereus are positioned among species of Acanthocereus within tribe Hylocereeae, indicating that they may be better classified within that genus.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The angiosperms, or flowering plants, diversified in the Cretaceous to dominate almost all terrestrial environments. Molecular phylogenetic studies indicate that the orders Amborellales, Nymphaeales and Austrobaileyales, collectively termed the ANA grade, diverged as separate lineages from a remaining angiosperm clade at a very early stage in flowering plant evolution. By comparing these early diverging lineages, it is possible to infer the possible morphology and ecology of the last common ancestor of the extant angiosperms, and this analysis can now be extended to try to deduce the developmental mechanisms that were present in early flowering plants. However, not all species in the ANA grade form convenient molecular-genetic models. SCOPE The present study reviews the genus Cabomba (Nymphaeales), which shows a range of features that make it potentially useful as a genetic model. We focus on characters that have probably been conserved since the last common ancestor of the extant flowering plants. To facilitate the use of Cabomba as a molecular model, we describe methods for its cultivation to flowering in the laboratory, a novel Cabomba flower expressed sequence tag database, a well-adapted in situ hybridization protocol and a measurement of the nuclear genome size of C. caroliniana. We discuss the features required for species to become tractable models, and discuss the relative merits of Cabomba and other ANA-grade angiosperms in molecular-genetic studies aimed at understanding the origin of the flowering plants.},

We used partial sequences of five independent WRKY loci to assess their potential for phylogeny reconstruction. Loci were originally isolated from Theobroma cacao L. by PCR with a single pair of degenerate primers; loci-specific primers were subsequently designed. We tested those loci across the sister genera Herrania Goudot and Theobroma L., with Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. as the outgroup. Overall, the combined WRKY matrices performed as well or better than other genes in resolving the intrageneric phylogeny of Herrania and Theobroma. The ease of isolating numerous, independent WRKY loci from diverse plant species with a single pair of degenerate primers designed to the highly conserved WRKY domain, renders them extremely useful tools for generating multiple, single or low copy nuclear loci for molecular phylogenetic studies at lower taxonomic levels.

In addition, we performed phylogenetic analyses based on rbcL and trnK intron. The complex was divided into 2 clades: B. aquatica-B. filifolia and B. guehoi-B. liniflora-B. rorida. Although members of the complex had conservative symmetric karyotypes, they were clearly differentiated on chromosomal rDNA distribution patterns. The sequence data indicated that ITS was almost homogeneous in all taxa in which two or four 45S rDNA arrays were frequently found at distal regions of chromosomes in the somatic karyotype. ITS homogenization could have been prompted by relatively distal 45S rDNA positions. In contrast, 2-12 5S rDNA arrays were mapped onto proximal/interstitial regions of chromosomes, and some paralogous 5S-NTS were found in the genomes harboring 4 or more arrays. 5S-NTS sequence type-specific FISH analysis showed sequence heterogeneity within and between some 5S rDNA arrays. Interlocus homogenization may have been hampered by their proximal location on chromosomes. Chromosomal location may have affected the contrasting evolutionary dynamics of rDNAs in the B. liniflora complex.},

Nevertheless, few molecular phylogenetic studies have tested this hypothesis using reconstructed historical biogeographies of plants within this zone. Here, we present a molecular phylogeny of Commiphora, a predominantly tropical African, arid-adapted tree genus, in order to test the monophyly of its taxonomic sections and identify clades that will help direct future study of this species-rich and geographically widespread taxon. We then use multiple fossil calibrations of Commiphora phylogeny to determine the timing of well-supported diversification events within the genus and interpret these age estimates to determine the relative contribution of vicariance and dispersal in the expansion of Commiphora's geographic range. We find that Commiphora is sister to Vietnamese Bursera tonkinensis and that its crown group radiation corresponds with the onset of the Miocene.},

However, few studies have investigated how these geological events may have influenced diversification. We present a multilocus phylogeny of 102 Protieae taxa (73\% of published species), sampled pantropically, to test hypotheses about the relative importance of dispersal, vicariance, habitat specialization, and biotic factors in the diversification of this ecologically dominant tribe of Neotropical trees. Bayesian fossil-calibrated analyses date the Protieae stem at 55 Mya. Biogeographic analyses reconstruct an initial late Oligocene/early Miocene radiation in Amazonia for Neotropical Protieae, with several subsequent late Miocene dispersal events to Central America, the Caribbean, Brazil's Atlantic Forest, and the Chocó. Regional phylogenetic structure results indicate frequent dispersal among regions throughout the Miocene and many instances of more recent regional in situ speciation. Habitat specialization to white sand or flooded soils was common, especially in Amazonia. There was one significant increase in diversification rate coincident with colonization of the Neotropics, followed by a gradual decrease consistent with models of diversity-dependent cladogenesis. Dispersal, biotic interactions, and habitat specialization are thus hypothesized to be the most important processes underlying the diversification of the Protieae.},

METHODS Here we use a time-calibrated phylogeny of a dominant group of trees in Madagascar's eastern rain forests, Canarium, and related Burseraceae (Canarieae), to test biogeographic hypotheses regarding the origin and radiation of the flora of this unique biome. RESULTS Our findings strongly support the monophyly of Malagasy Canarium, suggesting that this clade represents a previously undocumented in situ radiation. Contrary to expectations of dispersal from Africa during the Oligocene, concurrent with the formation of Madagascar's rain forest biome, our analyses support a late Miocene origin for Malagasy Canarium, probably by long distance dispersal from Southeast Asia. DISCUSSION Our study illustrates the importance of considering long distance dispersal as a viable explanation for clades with pantropical distributions diversifying subsequent to the Oligocene, and it highlights the formation of the Indo-Australian Archipelago and associated fast-moving equatorial surface currents, suggesting an under-appreciated evolutionary link among tropical centers of endemism. CONCLUSIONS We postulate that the relatively recent establishment and radiation of Canarium in Madagascar may have been facilitated by the highly stochastic climates associated with these forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Myco-heterotrophy evolved independently several times during angiosperm evolution. Although many species of myco-heterotrophic plants are highly endemic and long-distance dispersal seems unlikely, some genera are widely dispersed and have pantropical distributions, often with large disjunctions. Traditionally this has been interpreted as evidence for an old age of these taxa. However, due to their scarcity and highly reduced plastid genomes our understanding about the evolutionary histories of the angiosperm myco-heterotrophic groups is poor. RESULTS We provide a hypothesis for the diversification of the myco-heterotrophic family Burmanniaceae. Phylogenetic inference, combined with biogeographical analyses, molecular divergence time estimates, and diversification analyses suggest that Burmanniaceae originated in West Gondwana and started to diversify during the Late Cretaceous. Diversification and migration of the species-rich pantropical genera Burmannia and Gymnosiphon display congruent patterns. Diversification began during the Eocene, when global temperatures peaked and tropical forests occurred at low latitudes. Simultaneous migration from the New to the Old World in Burmannia and Gymnosiphon occurred via boreotropical migration routes. Subsequent Oligocene cooling and breakup of boreotropical flora ended New-Old World migration and caused a gradual decrease in diversification rate in Burmanniaceae. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that extant diversity and pantropical distribution of myco-heterotrophic Burmanniaceae is the result of diversification and boreotropical migration during the Eocene when tropical rain forest expanded dramatically.},

Most species are ornamental and several are threatened due to habitat loss and over collection. In this paper we examine the phylogenetics of Alcantarea and its relationship with the Brazilian members of Vriesea, a genus of which Alcantarea has been treated as a subgenus. We discuss the morphological evolution of the stamen position and its implication for pollination and the occurrence of Alcantarea in the Espinhaço mountain range rocky savanna-like habitat vegetation. DNA sequence data derived from two plastid markers (trnK-rps16, trnC-petN) and from a low copy nuclear gene (Floricaula/Leafy) together with 20 nuclear microsatellite loci were the data source to perform analyses and construct phylogenetic and Neighbor Joining trees for the genus. Alcantarea is well supported as monophyletic in both Bayesian and parsimony analyses, but sections of Vriesea, represented by the eastern Brazilian species, appear paraphyletic. Microsatellites delimit geographically isolated species groups. Nevertheless individuals belonging to a single species may appear related to distinct clusters of species, suggesting that hybridization and/or homoplasy and/or incomplete lineage sorting are also influencing the analysis based on such markers and may be the reasons for some unexpected results. Alcantarea brasiliana is hypothesized as putative hybrid between A. imperialis and A. geniculata. Spreading stamens, a morphological floral characteristic assumed to be related to Chiropterophily, apparently evolved multiple times within the genus, and invasion of rocky savanna-like habitat vegetation by Atlantic rainforest ancestors seems to have occurred multiple times as well.},

In this study, we aim to determine the factors underlying the extraordinary radiation of the subfamily Bromelioideae, one of the most diverse clades among the neotropical plant family Bromeliaceae. Based on an extended molecular phylogenetic data set, we examine the effect of two putative key innovations, that is, the Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and the water-impounding tank, on speciation and extinction rates. To this aim, we develop a novel Bayesian implementation of the phylogenetic comparative method, binary state speciation and extinction, which enables hypotheses testing by Bayes factors and accommodates the uncertainty on model selection by Bayesian model averaging. Both CAM and tank habit were found to correlate with increased net diversification, thus fulfilling the criteria for key innovations. Our analyses further revealed that CAM photosynthesis is correlated with a twofold increase in speciation rate, whereas the evolution of the tank had primarily an effect on extinction rates that were found five times lower in tank-forming lineages compared to tank-less clades. These differences are discussed in the light of biogeography, ecology, and past climate change.},

Three main genetic groups were revealed, with the chilensis group (P. chilensis, P. gilmartiniae, P. boliviensis) diverging first, and the alpestris (P. alpestris, P. berteroniana) and coerulea group (P. venusta, P. coerulea) forming sister groups. STRUCTURE analyses confirmed a hybrid origin of morphologically intermediate individuals, and detected several additional hybrids. Hybrids were found between the chilensis and alpestris group, and between the alpestris and coerulea group. Exclusion of hybrids improved phylogenetic reconstructions. The study demonstrates that the detection of hybrids within Bromeliaceae can be difficult based on morphological characters alone and that efficient reproductive barriers may only slowly establish, leading to hybridization between closely related sympatric species.

The PRK dataset exhibited a considerably higher proportion of potentially informative characters than the plastid dataset (16.9\% vs. 3.1\%), leading to a higher resolution and improved nodal support of the resulting phylogenies. Bromelia is resolved as sister to the remainder of the subfamily, albeit this relationship receives only weak nodal support. The basal position of Bromelia, as well as Deinacanthon, Greigia, Ochagavia, Fascicularia and Fernseea within the subfamily is corroborated and the remainder of the subfamily forms a highly supported clade (the eu-bromelioids). By the inclusion of nuclear data the sister group position of Fernseea to the eu-bromelioids is now highly supported. Within the eu-bromelioids the resolution of the clade representing the more advanced core bromelioids has increased and further demonstrates the highly problematic generic concept of Aechmea as well as Quesnelia. Moreover, the data were used to examine the evolution of sepal symmetry and the tank habit. Tracing of character transitions onto the molecular phylogeny implies that both characters have undergone only few transitions within the subfamily and thus are not as homoplasious as previously assumed. The character state reconstruction reveals the great importance of the evolution of the tank habit for the diversification of the core bromelioids.},

	abstract = {We developed a phylogeny of the core Bromelioideae including Aechmea and related genera, with the specific goals of investigating the monophyly of Aechmea and its allied genera, redefining monophyletic lineages for taxonomic revision, and investigating the biogeographic history of the group. Chloroplast, nuclear ribosomal, and low copy nuclear DNA sequences from 150 species within the Bromelioideae were used to develop the phylogeny. Phylogenies constructed with the combined four gene dataset provided sufficient resolution for investigating evolutionary relationships among species. Many genera are nested within Aechmea, or are rendered para- or polyphyletic by inclusion of Aechmea species. Several genera and subgenera of Aechmea with species in disjunct geographic locations are found to be polyphyletic, divided into separate clades that reflect geographic distribution rather than morphological similarity. This suggests that certain morphological characteristics thought to be indicative of common ancestry have instead evolved multiple times in parallel (i.e. ecological conservatism), possibly indicative of local adaptations to an epiphytic habit across the range of the Bromelioideae. These apparently homoplastic morphological characters used to assign species to genera or subgenera may be useful taxonomically when geography is also taken into account.},

Sequences were generated for 96 accessions corresponding to 60 species from 18 genera. Among these, 57 accessions represented 22 of the 31 recognized Fosterella species and one undescribed morphospecies. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods yielded well-resolved phylogenies. The monophyly of Fosterella was strongly supported, as was its sister relationship with a clade comprising Deuterocohnia, Dyckia and Encholirium. Six distinct evolutionary lineages were distinguished within Fosterella. Character mapping indicated that parallel evolution of identical character states is common in the genus. Relationships between species and lineages are discussed in the context of morphological, ecological and biogeographical data as well as the results of a previous amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) study.},

However, these systematic hypotheses have not yet been tested in a molecular phylogenetic framework. Here we present the first phylogenetic analysis of Orthophytum using nuclear and plastid markers (phytochrome C, and trnH-psbA and trnL-trnF spacers). Forty species representing the two main groups and all subgroups of Orthophytum, and the related genera Cryptanthus (8 spp.) and Lapanthus (2 spp.) were analyzed. The phylogenetic reconstruction revealed a well-supported clade termed Eu-Orthophytum, containing species with pedunculate inflorescences only. The Orthophytum species with sessile inflorescence formed two clades: (1) the amoenum group and (2) the vagans group plus O. foliosum, the only pedunculate Orthophytum species found outside Eu-Orthophytum. The vagans clade is in sister group position to Eu-Orthophytum. Within the latter, the subgroup mello-barretoi was sister to the most diversified clade, termed Core Orthophytum. Morphological character state reconstructions of floral characters used in previous taxonomic treatments as key diagnostic characters (penduncle presence, corolla form, and petal appendage form) showed different levels of homoplasy.},

This first molecular phylogenetic study of Puya and related bromeliads employs matK, trnS-trnG, rps16, and PHYC sequences. Chloroplast DNA, nuclear DNA, and combined DNA data all place Puya closest to subfamily Bromelioideae. Nuclear and combined data support Puya as monophyletic, and the two subgenera are nonmonophyletic. All data indicate that the Chilean species of Puya are early diverging within the genus, consistent with Chilean genera as the first-diverging members of subfamily Bromelioideae. Central Chile is identified as a key region for understanding the biogeographical history of Bromeliaceae, as is true with other South American plant groups. A complicated history involving early chloroplast capture and later secondary hybridization and/or introgression is seen in Chilean lineages. These events help explain the occurrence of sterile inflorescence tips, floral color and shape, and leaf indument. The ecological radiation of Puya appears coincident with the final, recent rise of the Andes and subsequent high-elevation habitat diversification. Additionally, geographical distribution, rather than moisture or elevational adaptations, correlates to species relationships. Evolution of CAM photosynthesis has occurred multiple times.},

We examined interspecific relationships of Ortgiesia based on Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP). Ninety-six accessions belonging to 14 species of Ortgiesia were sampled, and genotyped with 11 AFLP primer combinations. The neighbor joining (NJ) tree depicted two main genetic groups within Aechmea subgenus Ortgiesia, and four subgroups. The NJ tree showed short internal branches, indicating an overall shallow genetic divergence among Ortgiesia species as expected for the recently radiated subfamily Bromelioideae. Our results suggest that hybridization and/or incomplete lineage sorting may have hampered the reconstruction of interspecific relationships in Aechmea subgenus Ortgiesia. The mapping of petal color (yellow, blue, pink, or white), inflorescence type (simple or compound), and inflorescence shape (ellipsoid, subcylindric, cylindric, or pyramidal) against the NJ tree indicated that these characters are of limited taxonomic use in Aechmea subgenus Ortgiesia due to homoplasy.

We test these predictions by relating evolutionary shifts in form, physiology, and ecology to time and ancestral distributions, quantifying patterns of correlated and contingent evolution among pairs of traits and analyzing the apparent impact of individual traits on rates of net species diversification and geographic expansion beyond the ancestral Guayana Shield. All predicted patterns of correlated evolution were significant, and the temporal and spatial associations of phenotypic shifts with orogenies generally accorded with predictions. Net rates of species diversification were most closely coupled to life in fertile, moist, geographically extensive cordilleras, with additional significant ties to epiphytism, avian pollination, and the tank habit. The highest rates of net diversification were seen in the bromelioid tank-epiphytic clade (D(crown) = 1.05 My⁻¹), associated primarily with the Serra do Mar and nearby ranges of coastal Brazil, and in the core tillandsioids (D(crown) = 0.67 My⁻¹), associated primarily with the Andes and Central America. Six large-scale adaptive radiations and accompanying pulses of speciation account for 86\% of total species richness in the family.

We use a bromeliad phylogeny based on eight plastid regions to analyze relationships within the family, test a new, eight-subfamily classification, infer the chronology of bromeliad evolution and invasion of different regions, and provide the basis for future analyses of trait evolution and rates of diversification. METHODS We employed maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian approaches to analyze 9341 aligned bases for four outgroups and 90 bromeliad species representing 46 of 58 described genera. We calibrate the resulting phylogeny against time using penalized likelihood applied to a monocot-wide tree based on plastid ndhF sequences and use it to analyze patterns of geographic spread using parsimony, Bayesian inference, and the program S-DIVA. RESULTS Bromeliad subfamilies are related to each other as follows: (Brocchinioideae, (Lindmanioideae, (Tillandsioideae, (Hechtioideae, (Navioideae, (Pitcairnioideae, (Puyoideae, Bromelioideae))))))). Bromeliads arose in the Guayana Shield ca. 100 million years ago (Ma), spread centrifugally in the New World beginning ca. 16-13 Ma, and dispersed to West Africa ca. 9.3 Ma. Modern lineages began to diverge from each other roughly 19 Ma. CONCLUSIONS Nearly two-thirds of extant bromeliads belong to two large radiations: the core tillandsioids, originating in the Andes ca. 14.2 Ma, and the Brazilian Shield bromelioids, originating in the Serro do Mar and adjacent regions ca. 9.1 Ma.},

The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis revealed four major lineages in Cryptanthus and provided further evidence for the paraphyly of subgen. Hoplocryptanthus, while subgenus Cryptanthus was resolved as monophyletic. Monophyly of previously recognized morphological species groups at sectional level could not be confirmed. Based on the phylogenetic reconstruction we inferred the evolution of the sex system in Cryptanthus via maximum likelihood (ML) ancestral character reconstruction. Homoecy, the possession of hermaphrodite flowers only, was reconstructed as the ancestral state in the genus and characterizes three of the four main lineages within Cryptanthus. Andromonoecy, the possession of male and hermaphrodite flowers on the same plant, evolved only once and represents a synapomorphy of the fourth main lineage, C. subgen. Cryptanthus. The ancestral biome analysis reconstructed Cerrado (semiarid scrublands and forests) and campos rupestres (rock fields) as the most likely ancestral biomes for the genus. A shift to the Atlantic Forest biome was reconstructed to have occurred twice, in the ancestor of the first diverging lineage within the genus and in the ancestor of the C. subgen. Cryptanthus clade. A shift to the Caatinga (tropical dryland savanna) and one reversal to Cerrado (campos rupestres - rock fields) was reconstructed to have occurred once, in C. bahianus and C. arelii, respectively. The ancestral biome reconstruction indicates a high degree of niche conservatism within Cryptanthus with rare biome shifts throughout the evolution of the genus. Further, our results imply that the current infrageneric taxonomy of Cryptanthus is problematic and requires revision.},

One hundred and ten tillandsioid samples were analyzed, encompassing 10 genera, 104 species, and two cultivars. Two species of Bromelioideae, eight species of the polymorphic Pitcairnioideae, and two species of Rapateaceae were selected as outgroups. Parsimony analysis was based on sequence variation of five noncoding (partial 5' and 3' trnK intron, rps16 intron, trnL intron, trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer) and two coding plastid regions (rbcL and matK). Phylogenetic analyses of individual regions produced congruent, but mostly weakly supported or unresolved clades. Results of the combined data set, however, clearly show that subfamily Tillandsioideae is monophyletic. The earliest divergence separates a lineage comprised of Glomeropitcairnia and Catopsis from the "core" tillandsioids. In their present circumscriptions, genera Vriesea and Tillandsia, and their subgenera or sections, as well as Guzmania and Mezobromelia, are poly- and/or paraphyletic. Genera Alcantarea, Werauhia, Racinaea, and Viridantha appear monophyletic, but separation of these from Vriesea and Tillandsia makes the remainder paraphyletic. Nevertheless, Tillandsioideae separates into four main clades, which are proposed as tribes, viz., Catopsideae, Glomeropitcairnieae, Vrieseeae, and Tillandsieae.},

	abstract = {The tank-epiphytic clade of berry-fruited bromeliads, also known as the Core Bromelioideae, represents a remarkable event of adaptive radiation within the Bromeliaceae; however, the details of this radiation have been difficult to study because this lineage is plagued with generic delimitation problems. In this study, we used a phylogenetic approach to investigate a well supported, albeit poorly understood, lineage nested within the Core Bromelioideae, here called the "Ronnbergia Alliance". In order to assess the monophyly and phylogenetic relationships of this group, we used three plastid and three nuclear DNA sequence markers combined with a broad sampling across three taxonomic groups and allied species of Aechmea expected to comprise the Ronnbergia Alliance. We combined the datasets to produce a well-supported and resolved phylogenetic hypothesis. Our main results indicated that the Ronnbergia Alliance was a well-supported monophyletic group, sister to the remaining Core Bromelioideae, and it was composed by species of the polyphyletic genera Aechmea, Hohenbergia and Ronnbergia. We identified two major internal lineages with high geographic structure within the Ronnbergia Alliance. The first of these lineages, called the Pacific Clade, contained species of Aechmea and Ronnbergia that occur exclusively from southern Central America to northwestern South America. The second clade, called the Atlantic Clade, contained species of Aechmea, Hohenbergia and Ronnbergia mostly limited to the Atlantic Forest and the Caribbean. We also explored the diagnostic and evolutionary importance of 13 selected characters using ancestral character reconstructions on the phylogenetic hypothesis. We found that the combination of tubular corollas apically spreading and unappendaged ovules had diagnostic value for the Ronnbergia Alliance, whereas flower size, length of the corolla tube, and petal pigmentation and apex were important characters to differentiate the Pacific and Atlantic clades. This study opens new perspectives for future taxonomic reorganizations and provides a framework for evolutionary and biogeographic studies.},

Here we investigate the importance of these processes for the evolution of the tetraploid crucifer Capsella bursa-pastoris using DNA sequences from two chloroplast loci as well as from three nuclear low-copy genes. The near-absence of variation at the C. bursa-pastoris chloroplast markers suggests a single and recent origin of the tetraploid. However, despite supporting a single phylogeny, chloroplast data indicate that neither of the extant Capsella diploids is the maternal parent of the tetraploid. Combined with data from the three nuclear loci, our results do not lend support to previous hypotheses on the origin of C. bursa-pastoris as an allopolyploid between the diploids C. grandiflora and C. rubella or an autopolyploid of C. grandiflora. Nevertheless, for each locus, some of the C. bursa-pastoris accessions harbored C. rubella alleles, indicating that C. rubella contributed to the gene pool of C. bursa-pastoris, either through allopolyploid speciation or, more likely, through hybridization and introgression. To our knowledge, this study is the first of a wild, nonmodel plant genus that uses a combination of chloroplast and multiple low-copy nuclear loci for phylogenetic inference of polyploid evolution.},

The tribe currently includes seven genera: Aschersoniodoxa, Brayopsis, Dactylocardamum, Delpinophytum, Eudema, Onuris, and Xerodraba, and exhibits a wide morphological diversification in growth habit, inflorescences, and fruits. However, little is known about the phylogenetic relationships and evolution of the tribe. We present here a molecular phylogeny of representative sampling of all genera, utilizing sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS region and chloroplast regions trnL-F, trnH-psbA, and rps16. Additionally, climatic niches of the tribe and its main lineages, along with the evolution of diagnostic morphological characters, were studied. All analyses confirmed the monophyly of Eudemeae, with the exception of Delpinophytum that was included with genera of the lineage I of Brassicaceae. Eudemeae is divided into two main lineages differentiated by their geographical distribution and climatic niche: the primarily north-central Andean lineage included Aschersoniodoxa, Brayopsis, Dactylocardamum, and Eudema, and the Patagonian and southern Andean lineage included Onuris and Xerodraba. Finally, ancestral-state reconstructions in the tribe generally reveal multiple and independent gains or losses of diagnostic morphological characters, such as growth form, inflorescence reduction, and fruit type. Relevant taxonomic implications stemming from the results are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Numerous molecular systematic studies within Brassicaceae have resulted in a strongly improved classification of the family, as morphologically defined units at and above the generic level were often found to poorly reflect phylogenetic relationships. Here, we focus on tribe Alysseae, which despite its size (accounting for about 7\% of all species) has only received limited coverage in previous phylogenetic studies. Specifically, we want to test phylogenetic hypotheses implied by current tribal and generic circumscriptions and to put diversification within tribe Alysseae into a temporal context. To this end, sequence data from the nrDNA ITS and two plastid regions (ndhF gene, trnL-F intergenic spacer) were obtained for 176 accessions, representing 16 out of 17 currently recognized genera of the tribe, and were phylogenetically analysed, among others, using a relaxed molecular clock. Due to large discrepancies with respect to published ages of Brassicaceae, age estimates concerning Alysseae are, however, burdened with considerable uncertainty. The tribe is monophyletic and contains four strongly supported major clades and Alyssum homalocarpum, whose relationships among each other remain uncertain due to incongruences between nuclear and plastid DNA markers. The largest genus of the tribe, Alyssum, is not monophyletic and contains, apart from A. homalocarpum, two distinct lineages, corresponding to sections Alyssum, Psilonema, Gamosepalum and to sections Odontarrhena and Meniocus, respectively. Clypeola, whose monophyly is supported only by the plastid data, is very closely related to and possibly nested within the second Alyssum lineage. Species of the genus Fibigia intermingle with those of Alyssoides, Clastopus, Degenia, and Physoptychis, rendering Fibigia polyphyletic. The monotypic genera Leptoplax and Physocardamum are embedded in Bornmuellera.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Elucidating the selective and neutral forces underlying molecular evolution is fundamental to understanding the genetic basis of adaptation. Plants have evolved a suite of adaptive responses to cope with variable environmental conditions, but relatively little is known about which genes are involved in such responses. Here we studied molecular evolution on a genome-wide scale in two species of Cardamine with distinct habitat preferences: C. resedifolia, found at high altitudes, and C. impatiens, found at low altitudes. Our analyses focussed on genes that are involved in stress responses to two factors that differentiate the high- and low-altitude habitats, namely temperature and irradiation. RESULTS High-throughput sequencing was used to obtain gene sequences from C. resedifolia and C. impatiens. Using the available A. thaliana gene sequences and annotation, we identified nearly 3,000 triplets of putative orthologues, including genes involved in cold response, photosynthesis or in general stress responses. By comparing estimated rates of molecular substitution, codon usage, and gene expression in these species with those of Arabidopsis, we were able to evaluate the role of positive and relaxed selection in driving the evolution of Cardamine genes. Our analyses revealed a statistically significant higher rate of molecular substitution in C. resedifolia than in C. impatiens, compatible with more efficient positive selection in the former. Conversely, the genome-wide level of selective pressure is compatible with more relaxed selection in C. impatiens. Moreover, levels of selective pressure were heterogeneous between functional classes and between species, with cold responsive genes evolving particularly fast in C. resedifolia, but not in C. impatiens. CONCLUSIONS Overall, our comparative genomic analyses revealed that differences in effective population size might contribute to the differences in the rate of protein evolution and in the levels of selective pressure between the C. impatiens and C. resedifolia lineages. The within-species analyses also revealed evolutionary patterns associated with habitat preference of two Cardamine species. We conclude that the selective pressures associated with the habitats typical of C. resedifolia may have caused the rapid evolution of genes involved in cold response.},

It is represented in Australia and New Zealand by 19 and seven native species, respectively. In the present study we used a nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogeny in comparison with a cpDNA phylogeny to unravel the origin of Australian/New Zealand species. Although phylogenetic relationships within Lepidium s.s. were not fully resolved, the cpDNA data were in agreement with a Californian origin of Lepidium species from Australia/New Zealand. Strongly conflicting signals between the cp- and nuclear DNA phylogenetic analysis clearly indicated hybridogenous genomic constitution of Australian Lepidium s.s. species: All 18 studied Australian/New Zealand Lepidium s.s. species examined shared a Californian cpDNA type. While eleven Australian/New Zealand species appeared to harbor a Californian ITS type, a group of seven species shared a South African ITS type. This pattern is most likely explained by two trans-oceanic dispersals of Lepidium from California and Africa to Australia/New Zealand and subsequent hybridization followed by homogenization of the ribosomal DNA either to the Californian or South African ITS type in the two different lineages. Calibration of our molecular trees indicates a Pliocene/Pleistocene origin of Lepidium in Australia/New Zealand. Low levels of cpDNA and ITS sequence divergence and unresolved topologies within Australian/New Zealand species suggest a rapid and recent radiation of Lepidium after the hybridization event. This coincides with dramatic climatic changes in that geological epoch shaping the composition of the vegetation.},

We used the single-celled epidermal trichomes of Brassicaceae as a model to uncover the molecular evolutionary processes that contributed to the transition from dendritic trichomes, as seen in most species of Brassicaceae, to the distinctive stellate trichomes of the genus Physaria. We explored the role of positive selection on the evolution of BRANCHLESS TRICHOME (BLT), a candidate gene for changes in trichome branching pattern. Maximum likelihood models of codon evolution point to a shift in selective pressure affecting the evolution of BLT across the entire Physaria clade, and we found strong evidence that positive selection has acted on a subset of Physaria BLT codons. Almost all of the 10 codon sites with the highest probability of having evolved under positive selection are clustered in a predicted coiled-coil domain, pointing to changes in protein-protein interactions. Thus, our findings suggest that selection acted on BLT to modify its interactions with other proteins. The fact that positive selection occurred throughout the radiation of Physaria could reflect selection to stabilize development in response to an abrupt switch from the dendritic form to the stellate form, divergent selection for diversification of the stellate form, or both. These results point to the need for evolutionary developmental studies of BLT and its interacting proteins in Physaria.},

Because of the complex lineage relationships in Cardamine, the sampling included 22 taxa. In the results, both data sets are highly congruent in supporting a close relationship of C. amporitana to the widespread Eurasian C. amara. Low genetic variability in northeastern Spanish populations of C. amporitana suggests long-distance dispersal from central Italy. The interior position of the single northeastern Spanish haplotype in a statistical parsimony network of trnL-trnF haplotypes however does not support this scenario and invokes other plausible phylogeographic explanations. The disappearance of geographically intermediate populations and genetic impoverishment by migration and isolation, both probably associated with Quaternary climatic oscillations, appears as an alternative hypothesis to explain the phylogeographic pattern. A recent hybridization event is reported between C. amporitana and a diploid from the C. pratensis group in central Italy on the basis of additive polymorphisms in ITS for all the 22 distinguishing nucleotides.},

More than 500 species are distributed in the majority of mountain and alpine regions worldwide. This study provides the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis for the species assemblage and tests for association of trait and characters, providing the first explanations for the enormous species radiation since the mid Miocene. METHODS Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence variation of nuclear encoded loci and plastid DNA are used to unravel a reliable phylogenetic tree. Trait and ancestral area reconstructions were performed and lineage-specific diversification rates were calculated to explain various radiations in the last 15 Myr in space and time. KEY RESULTS A well-resolved phylogenetic tree demonstrates the paraphyly of the genus Arabis and a new systematic concept is established. Initially, multiple radiations involved a split between lowland annuals and mountain/alpine perennial sister species. Subsequently, increased speciation rates occur in the perennial lineages. The centre of origin of tribe Arabideae is most likely the Irano-Turanian region from which the various clades colonized the temperate mountain and alpine regions of the world. CONCLUSIONS Mid Miocene early diversification started with increased speciation rates due to the emergence of various annual lineages. Subsequent radiations were mostly driven by diversification within perennial species during the Pliocene, but increased speciation rates also occurred during that epoch. Taxonomic concepts in Arabis are still in need of a major taxonomic revision to define monophyletic groups.},

Phylogenetic analyses of the combined ITS and trnL-F markers indicate that Draba represents a monophyletic evolutionary lineage within the tribe Arabideae, but previously proposed infrageneric classification systems are mostly artificial (i.e. do not reflect true evolutionary history). Draba muralis formed an independent genus, possibly between Draba and Arabis, whereas D. hystrix fell outside Draba and was closely associated with Arabis. The New World annual, lowland Draba, D. platycarpa, D. reptans, D. cuneifolia, D. australis, D. arabidoides, (section Abdra) and D. brachycarpa and D. aspera (section Tomostima), appear to be independent genera that fall outside Draba and are monophyletic with the endemic North American Heterodraba unilateralis and Athysanus pusillus. Graellsia hederifolia and Erophila verna appear to be earlier diverging Draba species, with weak evidence of ancient hybridization in G. hederifolia. Core Draba species were organized into three major groups that encompass the segregate genera Drabopsis and Schivereckia. The three groups have geographic significance: Group I-Europe to Iran; Group II-North and South American Cordillera; Group III-Asian, Arctic, and Beringian. These three groups also have significant petal color and base chromosome level similarities. We also found that Arabis rimarum is a synonym for Draba aucheri, and is well within Group I of Core Draba. Therefore, we propose that many of the lowland and coastal temperate species often associated with Draba should be excluded from that genus. The compilation of these data indicate that true Draba are highly migrating arctic and higher alpine species that are most often perennial with white petals and n=8 as plesiomorphic characters.},

We were interested to determine whether or not allopollyploidy was a feature of Pachycladon, a genus which is hypothesised to have adaptively diversified onto different geological substrates in the mountains of the South Island of New Zealand. Phylogenetic analyses of five single-copy nuclear genes show that Pachycladon species have two copies of each gene representing two highly diverged evolutionary lineages from the Brassicaceae. Molecular clock analyses of all loci suggest that the two genome copies in Pachycladon diverged 8 million years ago, and that the allopolyploid origin of the genus occurred during the Pleistocene between 1.6 and 0.8 million years ago. This hybridization event at the origin of the Pachycladon radiation is perhaps the most extreme example yet reported of successful hybridization between distantly related parents.},

	abstract = {Matthiola (Brassicaceae) is a genus that is widespread in the Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian regions and includes two species that are endemic to the archipelagos of Madeira and the Canaries in Macaronesia, which is an insular oceanic hotspot of biodiversity harboring many radiating endemic plant lineages. Sequence analyses of the nuclear ITS-1 and ITS-2 regions in a comprehensive geographical sample of Matthiola, encompassing all the endemic Macaronesian populations known to date, suggest independent Mediterranean and NW African origins of the taxa in Madeira and the Canaries, respectively. These molecular data reveal a complex evolutionary landscape that converges with morphological analyses in the recognition of two new Madeiran species. The data also suggest that the Canarian infra-specific endemic taxa described thus far have high (but non-diagnostic) levels of morphological and genetic diversity, and should be included in the single endemic Matthiola bolleana. In agreement with earlier investigations that revealed a high genetic differentiation between the populations of Matthiola in Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, our phylogeny supports independent founder events from the same mainland congener to either island. The consistently derived position of the Moroccan populations within a mostly Canarian clade suggests a further back-colonization of the continent. Notably, the ITS sequence resolution offered by Matthiola is higher than that found in many of the radiating Canarian endemic lineages for which molecular phylogenetic studies abound. Hence, our research discovers largely unexplored pathways to understand plant diversification in this oceanic insular hotspot through the investigation of non-speciose endemics.},

	abstract = {Streptanthus is a genus of ca. 35 species in the tribe Thelypodieae (Brassicaceae) that has remarkable morphological and ecological diversity, a large number of species in the group being edaphic specialists endemic to unusual soils such as serpentine. While ecological research has shed some light on adaptation to serpentine in Streptanthus, there have been few insights on the origins and evolution of serpentine tolerance in this group, largely due to limited success in resolving the phylogenetic relationships among Streptanthus and allied genera of the Thelypodieae (Streptanthoid complex). We present a well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis for the Streptanthoid complex, based on three newly identified and highly variable single copy nuclear regions (AT4G34700, AT1G61620, and AT1G56590, and three others that are widely used (ITS, phyA, and PEPC). We also include data for two chloroplast regions (trnL and trnH-psbA). Collectively, our new markers provide 75\% of the nuclear parsimony informative characters in our data. Taxonomically, our sampling is the most inclusive of any study of the Streptanthoid Complex to date, including 46 out of the 53 species of Streptanthus and Caulanthus, as well as representatives of several closely allied genera in the Thelypodieae. Our results reveal that Streptanthus, Caulanthus, and Thelypodium are not reciprocally monophyletic as currently defined. The species of Streptanthus form two rather distantly related clades. One clade (SC-I) is comprised of species with bilateral flowers and urn-shaped calyces that occur mainly within the California Floristic Province (CFP) hotspot; the other clade (SC-II) is composed of species with extant ranges mainly outside the CFP. Our data indicate that serpentine tolerance has evolved between eight and ten times in this group, of which between four and five have resulted in endemism. While serpentine endemism has been rarely lost, large and diverse clades composed mainly of serpentine endemics indicate that serpentine endemics in this group are more than mere 'dead-ends'.},

The evolutionary history, ecological, morphological, and genetic diversity, and abundant resources and knowledge of Brassicaceae make it an excellent model family for evolutionary studies. Recent phylogenetic analyses of the family revealed three major lineages (I, II, and III), but relationships among and within these lineages remain largely unclear. Here, we present a highly supported phylogeny with six major clades using nuclear markers from newly sequenced transcriptomes of 32 Brassicaceae species and large data sets from additional taxa for a total of 55 species spanning 29 out of 51 tribes. Clade A consisting of Lineage I and Macropodium nivale is sister to combined Clade B (with Lineage II and others) and a new Clade C. The ABC clade is sister to Clade D with species previously weakly associated with Lineage II and Clade E (Lineage III) is sister to the ABCD clade. Clade F (the tribe Aethionemeae) is sister to the remainder of the entire family. Molecular clock estimation reveals an early radiation of major clades near or shortly after the Eocene-Oligocene boundary and subsequent nested divergences of several tribes of the previously polytomous Expanded Lineage II. Reconstruction of ancestral morphological states during the Brassicaceae evolution indicates prevalent parallel (convergent) evolution of several traits over deep times across the entire family. These results form a foundation for future evolutionary analyses of structures and functions across Brassicaceae.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF STUDY Many angiosperms have fruit morphologies that result in seeds from the same plant having different dispersal capabilities. A prime example is found in the Brassiceae (Brassicaceae), which has many members with segmented or heteroarthrocarpic fruits. Since only 40\% of the genera are heteroarthrocarpic, this tribe provides an opportunity to study the evolution of an ecologically significant novelty and its variants. METHODS We analyzed nuclear (PHYA) and plastid (matK) sequences from 66 accessions using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference approaches. The evolution of heteroarthrocarpy and its variants was evaluated using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood ancestral state reconstructions. KEY RESULTS Although nuclear and plastid phylogenies are incongruent with each other, the following findings are consistent: (1) Cakile, Crambe, Vella, and Zilla lineages are monophyletic; (2) the Nigra lineage is not monophyletic; and (3) within the Cakile clade, Cakile, Didesmus, and Erucaria are paraphyletic. Despite differences in the matK and PHYA topologies at both deep and shallow nodes, similar patterns of morphological evolution emerge. Heteroarthrocarpy, a complex morphological trait, has evolved multiple times across the tribe. Moreover, there are convergent transitions in dehiscence capabilities and fruit disarticulation across the tribe. CONCLUSIONS We present the first explicit analysis of fruit evolution within the Brassiceae, which exemplifies evolutionary lability. The repeated loss and gain of segment dehiscence and disarticulation suggests conservation in the genetic pathway controlling abscission with differential expression across taxa. This study provides a strong foundation for future studies of mechanisms underlying variation in dispersal capabilities of Brassiceae.},

Herein we study the allopolyploid Draba lactea and its close allies, which form a taxonomically intricate arctic-alpine complex including diploids, tetraploids, and hexaploids. Based on samples from the entire circumpolar area, we inferred the origins of polyploids in this complex using cloned DNA sequences from two nuclear regions (one intron from a gene encoding a second largest subunit in the RNA polymerase family, RPD2, and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region, ITS) and DNA fingerprints (random amplified polymorphic DNAs, RAPDs). Although D. lactea and all other polyploids examined in Draba are genetic alloploids showing fixed heterozygosity, the data obtained in the present study suggest that each of the polyploids analyzed here may have originated from a single diploid lineage: hexaploid D. lactea via tetraploid D. lactea from the D. palanderiana lineage (not from the D. fladnizensis and D. nivalis lineages as previously hypothesized), the tetraploid D. turczaninovii from the D. fladnizensis lineage, the tetraploid D. porsildii from the D. lonchocarpa lineage, and a tetraploid here named Draba spB from the D. nivalis lineage. Draba lactea has probably originated several times in the Beringian area, and it is not necessary to invoke complex origins based on a combination of different species lineages as previously suggested.},

These analyses support the monophyly of three major clades.

The two species endemic to Fuerteventura (C. sventenii) and Madeira (C. fruticosa) comprise a clade, providing the first evidence for a floristic link between the Eastern Canary Islands and the archipelago of Madeira. Both maximum likelihood and weighted parsimony analyses show that this clade is sister to the two other clades, although bootstrap support for this relationship is weak. Parsimony optimizations of ecological zones and island distribution suggest a colonization route from the low-altitude areas of the lowland scrub toward the high-elevation areas of the laurel and pine forests.

	volume = {27},

	abstract = {Brassicaceae is an important family at both the agronomic and scientific level. The family not only includes several model species, but it is also becoming an evolutionary model at the family level. However, resolving the phylogenetic relationships within the family has been problematic, and a large-scale molecular phylogeny in terms of generic sampling and number of genes is still lacking. In particular, the deeper relationships within the family, for example between the three major recognized lineages, prove particularly hard to resolve. Using a slow-evolving mitochondrial marker (nad4 intron 1), we reconstructed a comprehensive phylogeny in generic representation for the family. In addition, and because resolution was very low in previous single marker phylogenies, we adopted a supermatrix approach by concatenating all checked and reliable sequences available on GenBank as well as new sequences for a total 207 currently recognized genera and eight molecular markers representing a comprehensive coverage of all three genomes. The supermatrix was dated under an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock using a direct fossil calibration approach. Finally, a lineage-through-time-plot and rates of diversification for the family were generated. The resulting tree, the largest in number of genera and markers sampled to date and covering the whole family in a representative way, provides important insights into the evolution of the family on a broad scale. The backbone of the tree remained largely unresolved and is interpreted as the consequence of early rapid radiation within the family. The age of the family was inferred to be 37.6 (24.2-49.4) Ma, which largely agrees with previous studies. The ages of all major lineages and tribes are also reported. Analysis of diversification suggests that Brassicaceae underwent a rapid period of diversification, after the split with the early diverging tribe Aethionemeae. Given the dates found here, the family appears to have originated under a warm and humid climate approximately 37 Ma. We suggest that the rapid radiation detected was caused by a global cooling during the Oligocene coupled with a genome duplication event. This duplication could have allowed the family to rapidly adapt to the changing climate.},

	abstract = {Past studies have identified herbivory as a likely selection pressure for the evolution of hyperaccumulation, but few have tested the origin(s) of hyperaccumulation in a phylogenetic context. We focused on the evolutionary history of selenium (Se) hyperaccumulation in Stanleya (Brassicaceae). Multiple accessions were collected for all Stanleya taxa and two outgroup species. We sequenced four nuclear gene regions and performed a phylogenetic analysis. Ancestral reconstruction was used to predict the states for Se-related traits in a parsimony framework. Furthermore, we tested the taxa for Se localization and speciation using X-ray microprobe analyses. True hyperaccumulation was found in three taxa within the S. pinnata/bipinnata clade. Tolerance to hyperaccumulator Se concentrations was found in several taxa across the phylogeny, including the hyperaccumulators. X-ray analysis revealed two distinct patterns of leaf Se localization across the genus: marginal and vascular. All taxa accumulated predominantly (65-96\%) organic Se with the C-Se-C configuration. These results give insight into the evolution of Se hyperaccumulation in Stanleya and suggest that Se tolerance and the capacity to produce organic Se are likely prerequisites for Se hyperaccumulation in Stanleya.},

	abstract = {The family Brassicaceae comprises 3710 species in 338 genera, 25 recently delimited tribes, and three major lineages based on phylogenetic results from the chloroplast gene ndhF. To assess the credibility of the lineages and newly delimited tribes, we sequenced an approximately 1.8-kb region of the nuclear phytochrome A (PHYA) gene for taxa previously sampled for the chloroplast gene ndhF. Using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian methods, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the gene and used the approximately unbiased (AU) test to compare phylogenetic results from PHYA with findings from ndhF. We also combined ndhF and PHYA data and used a Bayesian mixed model approach to infer phylogeny. PHYA and combined analyses recovered the same three large lineages as those recovered in ndhF trees, increasing confidence in these lineages. The combined tree confirms the monophyly of most of the recently delimited tribes (only Alysseae, Anchonieae, and Descurainieae are not monophyletic), while 13 of the 23 sampled tribes are monophyletic in PHYA trees. In addition to phylogenetic results, we documented the trichome branching morphology of species across the phylogeny and explored the evolution of different trichome morphologies using the AU test. Our results indicate that dendritic, medifixed, and stellate trichomes likely evolved independently several times in the Brassicaceae.},

	abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana is the preeminent plant model organism. However, significant advances in evolution and ecology are being made by expanding the scope of research beyond this single species into the broader genus Arabidopsis. Surprisingly, few studies have rigorously investigated phylogenetic relationships between the nine Arabidopsis species, and this study evaluates both these and hypotheses related to two instances of intra-generic hybridization. DNA sequences from the 5' flanking region of the nuclear Atmyb2 gene from 12 of the 14 Arabidopsis taxa were used to reconstruct the generic phylogeny. The strict consensus tree was highly concordant with previous studies, identifying lineages corresponding to widespread species but exhibiting a large basal polytomy. Our data indicates that the paternal parent of the allopolyploid A. suecica is A. neglecta rather than A. arenosa s.l., although the need for a detailed phylogeographical study of these three species is noted. Finally, our data provided additional phylogenetic evidence of hybridization between Arabidopsis lyrata s.l. and A. halleri s.l. Taken together, the well-defined lineages within the genus and the potential for hybridization between them highlight Arabidopsis as a promising group for comparative and experimental studies of hybridization.},

	abstract = {The Brassicaceae is a large plant family (338 genera and 3,700 species) of major scientific and economic importance. The taxonomy of this group has been plagued by convergent evolution in nearly every morphological feature used to define tribes and genera. Phylogenetic analysis of 746 nrDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, representing 24 of the 25 currently recognized tribes, 146 genera, and 461 species of Brassicaceae, produced the most comprehensive, single-locus-based phylogenetic analysis of the family published to date. Novel approaches to nrDNA ITS analysis and extensive taxonomic sampling offered a test of monophyly for a large complement of the currently recognized tribes and genera of Brassicaceae. In the most comprehensive analysis, tribes Alysseae, Anchonieae plus Hesperideae, Boechereae, Cardamineae, Eutremeae, Halimolobeae, Iberideae, Noccaeeae, Physarieae, Schizopetaleae, Smelowskieae, and Thlaspideae were all monophyletic. Several broadly defined genera (e.g., Draba and Smelowskia) were supported as monophyletic, whereas others (e.g., Sisymbrium and Alyssum) were clearly polyphyletic. Analyses of ITS data identified several problematic sequences attributable to errors in sample identification or database submission. Results from parsimony ratchet and Bayesian analyses recovered little support for the backbone of the phylogeny, suggesting that many lineages of Brassicaceae have undergone rapid radiations that may ultimately be difficult to resolve with any single locus. However, the development of a preliminary supermatrix including the combination of 10 loci for 65 species provides an initial estimate of intertribal relations and suggests that broad application of such a method will provide greater understanding of relationships in the family.},

Here, we aimed to gain an understanding of the evolution of AtCIPK16, and orthologues of CIPK16 in other plant species including barley, by conducting a phylogenetic analysis of terrestrial plant species. The resulting protein sequence based phylogenetic trees revealed a single clade that included AtCIPK16 along with two segmentally duplicated CIPKs, AtCIPK5 and AtCIPK25. No monocots had proteins that fell into this clade; instead the most closely related monocot proteins formed a group basal to the entire CIPK16, 5 and 25 clade. We also found that AtCIPK16 contains a core Brassicales specific indel and a putative nuclear localisation signal, which are synapomorphic characters of CIPK16 genes. In addition, we present a model that proposes the evolution of CIPK16, 5 and 25 clade.},

	abstract = {Recent studies all indicated that both the affinities and subdivision of Boraginaceae s.str. are unsatisfactorily resolved. Major open issues are the placement and affinities of Boraginaceae s.str. in Boraginales and the major clades of the family, with especially the large tribes Cynoglosseae and Eritrichieae repeatedly retrieved as non-monophyletic groups, and the doubtful monophyly of several larger genera, especially Cynoglossum and Omphalodes. The present study addresses and solves these questions using two plastid markers (trnL-trnF, rps16) on the basis of a sampling including 16 outgroup taxa and 172 ingroup species from 65 genera. The phylogeny shows high statistical support for most nodes on the backbone and on the individual clades. Boraginaceae s.str. are sister to African Wellstediaceae, Wellstediaceae-Boraginaceae s.str. is sister to African Codonaceae. Echiochileae are retrieved as sister to the remainder of Boraginaceae s.str., which, in turn, fall into two major clades, the Boragineae-Lithospermeae (in a well-supported sister relationship) and the Cynoglosseae s.l. (including Eritrichieae). Cynoglosseae s.l. is highly resolved, with Trichodesmeae (incl. Microcaryum, Lasiocaryum) as sister to the remainder of the group. Eritrichieae s.str. (Eritrichium, Hackelia, Lappula) are resolved on a poorly supported polytomy together with the Omphalodes-clade (incl. Myosotidium, Cynoglossum p.p.), and the Mertensia-clade (incl. O. scorpioides, Asperugo). The Myosotideae (Myosotis, Trigonotis, Pseudomertensia) are retrieved in a well-supported sister-relationship to the core-Cynoglosseae, the latter comprising all other genera sampled. Cynoglossum is retrieved as highly para- and polyphyletic, with a large range of generic segregates embedded in Cynoglossum, but other species of Cynoglossum are sister to Microula or to the American "Eritrichieae" (Cryptantha and allied genera). Representatives of the genus Cynoglossum in its current definition are segregated onto six independent lineages, members of Omphalodes onto three independent lineages. At least 11 of the genera here sampled are deeply nested in other genera. The data show that individual details of nutlet morphology (e.g., winged margins, glochidia) are highly homoplasious. Conversely, a complex of nutlet characters (e.g., characters of the gynobase and cicatrix together with nutlet orientation and sculpturing) tends to circumscribe natural units. Geographical distribution of major clades suggests that the family originated in Africa and western Asia and radiated to eastern Eurasia, with several independent dispersal events into Australia and the New World.},

No molecular data on the phylogeny of these genera and Lithospermum have so far been published. We investigated the relationships within Lithospermeae using three loci (nuclear ITS plus 5.8S rRNA, chloroplast trnL-F-spacer, and trnS-G-spacer) and micromorphological character traits (pollen, nutlets). Lithospermums.l. constitutes the sistergroup of Asian Ulugbekia and is monophyletic only when its American segregates "Macromeria", monotypic Nomosa, and Onosmodium are included. Both the African and the South American species groups of Lithospermum are monophyletic, but North American representatives are not resolved in a single clade. Morphological characters that have been considered as important for generic delimitation in the past (such as large, yellow corollas without faucal scales, particular pollen types, coarsely veined leaves, shrubby habit) have evolved in at least two only distantly related lineages within Lithospermums.l. The reduction of American "Macromeria", Nomosa, and Onosmodium as well as Asian Ulugbekia under Lithospermum is proposed to render the latter monophyletic. This redefined Lithospermum s.l. appears to have undergone a type of recent "island radiation" in the Americas, reflected in a morphological diversity far exceeding that found in the Old World.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Numerous molecular phylogenetic studies have used new biogeographic tools to explain species distributions. However, questions remain about origins, timing, direction of movement, and relationships between range expansion and diversification. We investigated geographic origins and temporal and spatial diversification of Mertensia, giving particular attention to divergence between Asian and North American lineages and radiation of western North American clades. METHODS Divergence time estimation and biogeographic analyses were based on phylogeny reconstruction inferred from nuclear ribosomal ITS and 12 plastid DNA sequence regions and a broad sampling of Mertensia, Boraginaceae, and core eudicots. KEY RESULTS Mertensia split from Asperugo in the late Oligocene to mid Miocene (26.83-12.22 million years ago [Ma]), followed by the first divergence in the crown group in the late Miocene (10.36-5.19 Ma). The ancestral area is inferred to have been Asia or a widespread distribution across Asia, Beringia, and circumboreal locales. Initial range expansion of North American Mertensia occurred in Beringia and the Pacific Northwest (7.70-4.22 Ma), followed by diversification of three clades (Pacific Northwest, southern Rocky Mountains, central Rocky Mountains). CONCLUSIONS The crown divergence of extant Mertensia coincides with the onset of extreme cooling and fragmentation of a once extensive mixed mesophytic forest that was subsequently replaced by a boreal coniferous forest. Early diversification likely occurred when Beringia was connected and available for floristic exchange. The north-south orientation of the Rocky Mountain Range and Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles appear to have been important in the North American diversification of Mertensia.},

One of the classic patterns of plant disjunction involves New World amphitropical disjuncts, as exemplified by Tiquilia subg. Tiquilia (Boraginaceae). Subgenus Tiquilia forms a heterogeneous group of {\textasciitilde}20 species that is amphitropically distributed in the deserts of North and South America, with four taxa endemic to the Galápagos Islands. The current study reconstructs the biogeographic history of subg. Tiquilia in order to explore the origins of New World amphitropical disjunction and of Galápagos endemism. A strongly supported phylogeny of the subgenus is estimated using sequence data from matK, ndhF, rps16, ITS, and waxy. Biogeographic analyses using combined and individual marker data sets reveal a complex history of long-distance dispersal in subg. Tiquilia. Biogeographic reconstructions imply a North American origin of the subgenus and its three major lineages and require at least four long-distance dispersal events to explain its current distribution. The South American taxa of subg. Tiquilia result from three independent and nonsimultaneous colonization events, while the monophyly and continental origins of the Galápagos endemics are unresolved. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence that intercontinental dispersal has been more common than previously realized.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ympev.2006.01.020},
	abstract = {Although the deserts of North America are of very recent origin, their characteristic arid-adapted endemic plant lineages have been suggested to be much older. Earlier researchers have hypothesized that the ancestors of many of these modern desert lineages first adapted to aridity in highly localized arid or semi-arid sites as early as the late Cretaceous or early Tertiary, and that these lineages subsequently spread and diversified as global climate became increasingly arid during the Cenozoic. No study has explicitly examined these hypotheses for any North American arid-adapted plant group. The current paper tests these hypotheses using the genus Tiquilia (Boraginaceae), a diverse North American desert plant group. A strongly supported phylogeny of the genus is estimated using combined sequence data from three chloroplast markers (matK, ndhF, and rps16) and two nuclear markers (ITS and waxy). Ages of divergence events within the genus are estimated using penalized likelihood and a molecular clock approach on the ndhF tree for Tiquilia and representative outgroups, including most of the major lineages of Boraginales. The dating analysis suggests that the stem lineage of Tiquilia split from its nearest extant relative in the Paleocene or Eocene ( approximately 59-48 Ma). This was followed by a relatively long period before the first divergence in the crown group near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary ( approximately 33-29 Ma), shortly after the greatest Cenozoic episode of rapid aridification. Divergence of seven major lineages of Tiquilia is dated to the early-to-mid Miocene ( approximately 23-13 Ma). Several major lineages show a marked increase in diversification concomitant with the onset of more widespread semi-arid and then arid conditions beginning in the late Miocene ( approximately 7 Ma). This sequence of divergence events in Tiquilia agrees well with earlier researchers' ideas concerning North American desert flora assembly.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Boragineae is one of the main tribes of Boraginaceae, but delimitation and intergeneric classification of this group are unclear and have not yet been studied using DNA sequences. In particular, phylogenetic relationships in Anchusa s.l. still need to be elucidated in order to assess its taxonomic boundaries with respect to the controversial segregate genera Hormuzakia, Gastrocotyle, Phyllocara and Cynoglottis. METHODS Phylogenetic relationships among 51 taxa of tribe Boragineae were investigated by comparative sequencing of the trnL(UAA) intron of the plastid genome and of the ITS1 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Exemplar taxa from 16 genera of Boragineae and all subgenera of Anchusa s.l. were included, along with two selected outgroups from tribes Lithospermeae and Cynoglosseae. KEY RESULTS Phylogenies generated by maximum parsimony and combined ITS1-trnL sequences support the monophyly of the tribe and a split into two clades, Pentaglottis and the remainder of Boragineae. The latter contains two large monophyletic groups. The first consists of three moderately to well-supported branches, Borago-Symphytum, Pulmonaria-Nonea and Brunnera. In the Pulmonaria-Nonea subclade, the rare endemic Paraskevia cesatiana is sister to Pulmonaria, and Nonea appears to be paraphyletic with respect to Elizaldia. The second main group corresponds to the well-supported clade of Anchusa s.l., with the megaphyllic, polyploid herb Trachystemon orientalis as sister taxon, although with low support. Anchusa s.l. is highly paraphyletic to its segregate genera and falls into four subclades: (1) Phyllocara, Hormuzakia, Anchusa subgenus Buglossum and A. subgenus Buglossoides; (2) Gastrocotyle; (3) A. subgenus Buglossellum and Cynoglottis; and (4) A. subgenus Anchusa, Lycopsis and Anchusella. All species of Anchusa subg. Anchusa, including the South African A. capensis, are included in a single unresolved clade. Anchusa subgenus Limbata is also included here despite marked divergence in floral morphology. The low nucleotide variation of ITS1 suggests a recent partly adaptive radiation within this group. CONCLUSIONS Molecular data show that nine of the usually accepted genera of the Boragineae consisting of two or more species are monophyletic: Anchusella, Borago, Brunnera, Cynoglottis, Gastrocotyle, Hormuzakia, Nonea, Pulmonaria and Symphytum. In addition, the tribe includes the four monotypic genera Paraskevia, Pentaglottis, Phyllocara and Trachystemon. The morphologically well-characterized segregate genera in Anchusa s.l. are all confirmed by DNA sequences and should be definitively accepted. Most of the traditionally recognized subgenera of Anchusa are also supported as monophyletic groups by both nuclear and plastid sequence data. In order to bring taxonomy in line with phylogeny, the institution of new, independent generic entities for subgenera Buglossum, Buglossellum and Buglossoides and a narrower but more natural concept of Anchusa are advocated.},

With minor exceptions, all names have been verified in their original place of publication, and all were nomenclaturally assessed. Colour coding is used to distinguish between names (in green) pertaining to Cynoglossum sensu lato, for which complete synonymies are provided; and names (in orange) pertaining to other genera but published under Cynoglossum or its segregates. They are listed together with their basionym and the corresponding correct name (if it exists), but without complete synonymy. Acceptable, potentially correct names appear in bold-face type, both under a broadly defined Cynoglossum (for which purpose validation of 81 new combinations and the name of 1 new species was necessary) and under one or more of its segregates. When a name was published for a new taxon, original material is indicated, usually by direct quotation from the protologue. New type designations are exceptional (two cases), whereas former type designations are cited whenever known. Furthermore, types and original specimens, especially when their digital images are available online, are mentioned with their locations and accession numbers. Comments are added whenever appropriate, especially to explain nomenclatural assessments that are not self-evident.},

In contrast to the limited resolution of standard molecular markers (nrDNA and plastid sequences), the Delta(6)-desaturase sequence phylogeny of Echium unequivocally reconstructs its active colonization across islands and archipelagos (Madeira, the Canary Islands, and Cape Verde), as well as its subsequent geographical and ecological speciation. Molecular-clock estimates using penalized likelihood and Bayesian inference reveal two radiation processes coincident with two dramatic climatic changes recorded in the region: the advent of the cold Canarian sea current (ca. 4 Ma) and the establishment of a strong seasonality in the Pleistocene (1.8 Ma). Though Echium had available all the diversity of present-day Macaronesian environments (xeric and mesic scrub, laurisilva, pine forest, and subalpine habitats) in the Miocene, evolutionary divergence appears to have been triggered by an extension of fluctuating xeric and mesic habitats with the advent of Pliocene conditions. These Echium radiations not only fulfill traditional predictions of adaptive radiation (i.e., common ancestry, rapid speciation, and phenotype-environment correlation), but also, uniquely among Macaronesian species, trait utility of woodiness. A Pliocene transition from annuality to a bush or tree-like condition occurred in early Echium lineages. Maintenance of woodiness in major lineages, and reversal to an herbaceous condition by three independent events, is reported for the first time in plants of oceanic islands.},

Therefore, cytogenetic studies of polyploidy-prone groups such as the tropical Malvaceae and plant formations such as as the Brazilian Cerrado have gained further importance. We present new chromosome counts for Cerrado Bombacoideae and revised chromosome numbers for the Malvaceae s.l., compare these between subfamilies, and relate them to phylogenetic signal.• METHODS We studied the chromosome number of Eriotheca candolleana, E. gracilipes, E. pubescens, Pachira glabra, Pseudobombax longiflorum, and P. tomentosum. We also compared Eriotheca species ploidy levels using flow cytometry. We compiled chromosome numbers for 557 species of Malvaceae s.l., including 37 Bombacoideae species. We included this information in a phylogenetic reconstruction based on chloroplast matK-trnK DNA to evaluate chromosome evolution of the Malvaceae s.l. and the Bombacoideae in particular.• KEY RESULTS The Cerrado Bombacoideae presented consistently high chromosome numbers. Numbers for Eriotheca species were among the highest and varied among populations. Flow cytometry analyses showed similar 1Cx DNA for all cytotypes and indicated neopolyploidy. Chromosome numbers differed between subfamilies, with the lowest numbers in the Malvoideae and Byttnerioideae and the highest in Tilioideae. Chromosome numbers had significant phylogenetic signal for Bombacoideae but not for Malvoideae or Malvaceae s.l.• CONCLUSIONS Clearly distinct chromosome numbers allied to monophyly provide some support for a circumscription of the Bombacoideae and distinction within the Malvaceae. The phylogenetic signal for chromosome number supports the idea of an ancient WGD and further neopolyploidy events as important evolutionary trends for the Bombacoideae.},

	abstract = {Bombacoideae (Malvaceae) is a clade of deciduous trees with a marked dominance in many forests, especially in the Neotropics. The historical lack of a well-resolved phylogenetic framework for Bombacoideae hinders studies in this ecologically important group. We reexamined phylogenetic relationships in this clade based on a matrix of 6465 nuclear (ETS, ITS) and plastid (matK, trnL-trnF, trnS-trnG) DNA characters. We used maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference to infer relationships among 108 species (∼70\% of the total number of known species). We analyzed the evolution of selected morphological traits: trunk or branch prickles, calyx shape, endocarp type, seed shape, and seed number per fruit, using ML reconstructions of their ancestral states to identify possible synapomorphies for major clades. Novel phylogenetic relationships emerged from our analyses, including three major lineages marked by fruit or seed traits: the winged-seed clade (Bernoullia, Gyranthera, and Huberodendron), the spongy endocarp clade (Adansonia, Aguiaria, Catostemma, Cavanillesia, and Scleronema), and the Kapok clade (Bombax, Ceiba, Eriotheca, Neobuchia, Pachira, Pseudobombax, Rhodognaphalon, and Spirotheca). The Kapok clade, the most diverse lineage of the subfamily, includes sister relationships (i) between Pseudobombax and "Pochota fendleri" a historically incertae sedis taxon, and (ii) between the Paleotropical genera Bombax and Rhodognaphalon, implying just two bombacoid dispersals to the Old World, the other one involving Adansonia. This new phylogenetic framework offers new insights and a promising avenue for further evolutionary studies. In view of this information, we present a new tribal classification of the subfamily, accompanied by an identification key.},

	abstract = {Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses have revealed that elements of the former families Malvaceae sensu stricto and Bombacaceae together form a well-supported clade that has been named Malvatheca. Within Malvatheca, two major lineages have been observed; one, Bombacoideae, corresponds approximately to the palmate-leaved Bombacaceae, and the other, Malvoideae, includes the traditional Malvaceae (the mallows or Eumalvoideae). However, the composition of these two groups and their relationships to other elements of Malvatheca remain a source of uncertainty. Sequence data from two plastid regions, ndhF and trnK/matK, from 34 exemplars of Malvatheca and six outgroups were analyzed. Parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of the sequence data provided a well-resolved phylogeny except that relationships among five lineages at the base of Malvatheca are poorly resolved. Nonetheless, a 6-bp insertion in matK suggests that Fremontodendreae is sister to the remainder of Malvatheca. Our results suggest that the Malvoideae originated in the Neotropics and that a mangrove taxon dispersed across the Pacific from South America to Australasia and later radiated out of Australasia to give rise to the ca. 1700 living species of Eumalvoideae. Local clock analyses imply that the plastid genome underwent accelerated molecular evolution coincident with the dispersal out of the Americas and again with the radiation into the three major clades of Eumalvoideae.},

Phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast sequences (rbcL, ndhF, trnL-F) were undertaken to infer evolutionary relationships in Bignoniaceae and to revise its classification. Eight clades are recognized as tribes (Bignonieae, Catalpeae, Coleeae, Crescentieae, Jacarandeae, Oroxyleae, Tecomeae, Tourrettieae); additional inclusive clades are named informally. Jacarandeae and Catalpeae are resurrected; the former is sister to the rest of the family, and the latter occupies an unresolved position within the "core" Bignoniaceae. Tribe Eccremocarpeae is included in Tourrettieae. Past classifications recognized a large Tecomeae, but this tribe is paraphyletic with respect to all other tribes. Here Tecomeae are reduced to a clade of approximately 12 genera with a worldwide distribution in both temperate and tropical ecosystems. Two large clades, Bignonieae and Crescentiina, account for over 80\% of the species in the family. Coleeae and Crescentieae are each included in larger clades, the Paleotropical alliance and Tabebuia alliance, respectively; each alliance includes a grade of taxa assigned to the traditional Tecomeae. Parsimony inference suggests that the family originated in the neotropics, with at least five dispersal events leading to the Old World representatives.},

	abstract = {The origin of Neotropical biodiversity represents a key question in evolutionary biology. Despite the attempts to decipher the role of ecological and historical factors to present-day distribution patterns, robust phylogenetic studies of Neotropical clades are still needed before a comprehensive picture of the origin of Neotropical biodiversity can be achieved. Tynanthus Miers (Bignonieae, Bignoniaceae) is a well-circumscribed genus of Neotropical lianas with species that are narrowly distributed, except from a few taxa. The genus is characterized by a clove odor, small bilabiate flowers with the two upper lobes almost fused, and fruits with raised margins, all of which represent morphological synapomorphies for this clade. Other distinctive characters are the thecae reflexed forward, the densely pubescent ovaries and the poorly-developed nectariferous disk. The circumscription of the genus has remained constant over the years, despite the problematic limits of most genera of tribe Bignonieae. In this study, we reconstruct the phylogeny of Tynanthus based on two plastid (ndhF and rpl32-trnL) and one nuclear (pepC) markers and use this phylogenetic framework to investigate the biogeographical history of the genus. Our phylogenetic hypothesis provides further support for the monophyly of Tynanthus, and strongly supports a series of infra-generic clades. Most species are reconstructed as monophyletic, while T. cognatus and T. polyanthus are paraphyletic. Biogeographic reconstructions suggest that Tynanthus originated between 9.4 and 21.5Mya, most likely at approximately 15.3Mya. The MRCA of the genus was likely broadly distributed through lowland Amazonia, Western South America and Central America and diversified in the Neotropics during the Miocene. Closely related species are generally distributed within the same biogeographic area, suggesting that niche conservatism has played an important role in the diversification history of the group.},

	abstract = {Combining high-throughput sequencing data with amplicon sequences allows the reconstruction of robust phylogenies based on comprehensive sampling of characters and taxa. Here, we combine Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing data to infer the phylogeny of the "Adenocalymma-Neojobertia" clade (Bignonieae, Bignoniaceae), a diverse lineage of Neotropical plants, using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches. We used NGS to obtain complete or nearly-complete plastomes of members of this clade, leading to a final dataset with 54 individuals, representing 44 members of ingroup and 10 outgroups. In addition, we obtained Sanger sequences of two plastid markers (ndhF and rpl32-trnL) for 44 individuals (43 ingroup and 1 outgroup) and the nuclear PepC for 64 individuals (63 ingroup and 1 outgroup). Our final dataset includes 87 individuals of members of the "Adenocalymma-Neojobertia" clade, representing 66 species (ca. 90\% of the diversity), plus 11 outgroups. Plastid and nuclear datasets recovered congruent topologies and were combined. The combined analysis recovered a monophyletic "Adenocalymma-Neojobertia" clade and a paraphyletic Adenocalymma that also contained a monophyletic Neojobertia plus Pleonotoma albiflora. Relationships are strongly supported in all analyses, with most lineages within the "Adenocalymma-Neojobertia" clade receiving maximum posterior probabilities. Ancestral character state reconstructions using Bayesian approaches identified six morphological synapomorphies of clades namely, prophyll type, petiole and petiolule articulation, tendril ramification, inflorescence ramification, calyx shape, and fruit wings. Other characters such as habit, calyx cupular trichomes, corolla color, and corolla shape evolved multiple times. These characters are putatively related with the clade diversification and can be further explored in diversification studies.},

Here, maximum parsimony analysis using ITS and trnL-F sequences resulted in similar trees and showed that the genus is monophyletic. Analysis of the combined data resulted in a single tree with five major clades highly supported and well resolved. The relationships of the five major clades are (subgenus Niedzwedzkia (Incarvillea olgae (subgenus Amphicome (subgenus Incarvillea, subgenus Pteroscleris)))). All four subgenera are well supported for monophyly, with the exception of subgenus Incarvillea, represented here by I. sinensis and I. olgae. Incarvillea olgae is not closely related to I. sinensis, a conclusion supported by morphology. The two basal monotypic subgenera are found in Central Asia. The most species-rich subgenus, Pteroscleris, has 10 species in the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains and may have dispersed early from central Asia to eastern Asia. Short branch lengths on the molecular trees within Pteroscleris suggest a recent and rapid radiation of this rosette-forming subgenus, perhaps connected with the uplift of the Himalaya-Hengduan massif.},

The study is based on plastid and nuclear DNA regions and includes 47 species representing the five currently recognized genera (including all the species occurring in the western Indian Ocean region). Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses supported (i) the monophyly of the tribe, (ii) the monophyly of Phylloctenium, Phyllarthron and Rhodocolea and (iii) the paraphyly of Colea due to the inclusion of species of Ophiocolea. The latter genus was also recovered paraphyletic due to the inclusion of two species of Colea (C. decora and C. labatii). The taxonomic implications of the mutual paraphyly of these two genera are discussed in light of morphological evidence, and it is concluded that the two genera should be merged, and the necessary new nomenclatural combinations are provided. The phylogenetic framework shows Phylloctenium, which is endemic to Madagascar and restricted to dry ecosystems, as basal and sister to the rest of the tribe, suggesting Madagascar to be the centre of origin of this clade. The remaining genera are diversified mostly in humid ecosystems, with evidence of multiple dispersals to the neighboring islands, including at least two to the Comoros, one to Mauritius and one to the Seychelles. Finally, we hypothesize that the ecological success of this tribe might have been triggered by a shift of fruit-dispersal mode from wind to lemur.},

	abstract = {The radiation of angiosperms is associated with shifts among pollination modes that are thought to have driven the diversification of floral forms. However, the exact sequence of evolutionary events that led to such great diversity in floral traits is unknown for most plant groups. Here, we characterize the patterns of evolution of individual floral traits and overall floral morphologies in the tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae). We identified 12 discrete traits that are associated with seven floral types previously described for the group and used a penalized likelihood tree of the tribe to reconstruct the ancestral states of those traits at all nodes of the phylogeny of Bignonieae. In addition, evolutionary correlations among traits were conducted using a maximum likelihood approach to test whether the evolution of individual floral traits followed the correlated patterns of evolution expected under the "pollination syndrome" concept. The ancestral Bignonieae flower presented an Anemopaegma-type morphology, which was followed by several parallel shifts in floral morphologies. Those shifts occurred through intermediate stages resulting in mixed floral morphologies as well as directly from the Anemopaegma-type morphology to other floral types. Positive and negative evolutionary correlations among traits fit patterns expected under the pollination syndrome perspective, suggesting that interactions between Bignonieae flowers and pollinators likely played important roles in the diversification of the group as a whole.},

In disagreement with the classical division of the genus Betula, B. schmidtii and B. nana grouped with the species in subgenus Betula, and B. ermanii grouped with species in subgenus Chamaebetula, including B. humilis and B. fruticosa.

In this regard, however, far less attention has been paid to the southern and south-eastern declivities of the QTP, i.e. the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains (HHM) region. Here, we report a survey of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence variation in the HHM endemic Sinopodophyllum hexandrum, a highly selfing alpine perennial herb with mainly gravity-dispersed berries (105 individuals, 19 localities). We specifically aimed to test a vicariant evolutionary hypothesis across the 'Mekong-Salween Divide', a known biogeographic and phytogeographic boundary of north-to-south trending river valleys separating the East Himalayas and Hengduan Mts. Both cpDNA and AFLPs identified two divergent phylogroups largely congruent with these mountain ranges. There was no genetic depauperation in the more strongly glaciated East Himalayas (AFLPs: H(E)=0.031; cpDNA: h(S)=0.133) compared to the mainly ice-free Hengduan Mts. (AFLPs: H(E)=0.037; cpDNA: h(S)=0.082), while population differentiation was consistently higher in the former region (AFLPs: Φ(ST)=0.522 vs. 0.312; cpDNA: Φ(ST)=0.785 vs. 0.417). Our results suggest that East Himalayan and Hengduan populations of S. hexandrum were once fragmented, persisted in situ during glacials in both areas, and have not merged again, except for a major instance of inter-lineage chloroplast capture identified at the MSD boundary. Our coalescent time estimate for all cpDNA haplotypes (c. 0.37-0.48 mya), together with paleogeological evidence, strongly rejects paleo-drainage formation as a mechanism underlying allopatric fragmentation, whereas mountain glaciers following the ridges of the MSD during glacials (and possible interglacials) could have been responsible. This study thus indicates an important role for mountain glaciers in driving (incipient) allopatric speciation across the MSD in the HHM region by causing vicariant lineage divergence and acting as barriers to post-divergence gene flow.},

A notable exception is the non-monophyly of the group Occidentales of compound-leaved Berberis (previously separated as Mahonia). At lower levels, however, most of previous sections and subsections were not evident especially in simple-leaved Berberis. Possible relationship between section Horridae (group Occidentales) and the simple-leaved Berberis clade implies paraphyly of the compound-leaved Berberis. A well-known South America-Old World (mainly Asia) disjunctive distribution pattern of the simple-leaved Berberis is explained by a vicariance event occurring in the Cretaceous period. The ITS phylogeny also suggests that a possible connection between the Asian and South American groups through the North American species ( Berberis canadensis or B. fendleri) is highly unlikely.},

Ovary and fruit characters which are crucial in current sectional circumscriptions were mapped on the phylogeny to assess their utility in infrageneric classifications. The results indicate that the strong systematic emphasis placed on single, homoplasious characters such as undivided placenta lamellae (section Reichenheimia) and fleshy pericarps (section Sphenanthera), and the recognition of sections primarily based on a suite of plesiomorphic characters including three-locular ovaries with axillary, bilamellate placentae and dry, dehiscent pericarps (section Diploclinium), has resulted in the circumscription of several polyphyletic sections. Moreover, sections Platycentrum and Petermannia were recovered as paraphyletic. Because of the homoplasy of systematically important characters, current classifications have a certain diagnostic, but only poor predictive value.

	abstract = {This paper presents a historical biogeographic analysis of African Begonia based on combined internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and trnL intron sequences. Age range estimates for Begonia in Africa ranged from only 1.5 Ma for some terminal nodes to 27 Ma for basal nodes when the ages of Réunion (2 Ma) andMayotte (5.4 Ma) were used to date the split between Begonia salaziensis and Begonia comorensis. Assuming a more recent origin age for Begonia salaziensis (2 Ma) provided age estimates in other parts of the phylogeny which agreed with patterns observed in other African organisms. A large proportion of the Begonia diversity seen today in Africa is of pre-Pleistocene origin. Species of Pleistocene origin are concentrated in species-rich groups such as sections Loasibegonia, Scutobegonia, and Tetraphila, which have their centre of diversity in western Central Africa. Phylogenetically isolated taxa such as Begonia longipetiolata, Begonia iucunda, and Begonia thomeana date to the late Miocene, a period of extended aridification on the African continent that had severe effects on African rain forest species. A general pattern is identified where phylogenetically isolated species occur outside the main identified rain forest refuges. Endemic species on the island of São Tomé such as Begonia baccata, Begonia molleri, and Begonia subalpestris appear to be palaeoendemics. Of these species, the most recent age estimate is for B. baccata, which is dated at ca. 3 Ma. Therefore, São Tomé appears to have functioned as an important (if previously unrecognised) pre-Pleistocene refuge. On the mainland, areas such as the Massif of Chaillu in Gabon, southern Congo (Brazzaville), and far western areas of Congo (Kinshasa) have played similar roles to São Tomé.},

	abstract = {The Begoniaceae consist of two genera, Begonia, with approximately 1400 species that are widely distributed in the tropics, and Hillebrandia, with one species that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and the only member of the family native to those islands. To help explain the history of Hillebrandia on the Hawaiian Archipelago, phylogenetic relationships of the Begoniaceae and the Cucurbitales were inferred using sequence data from 18S, rbcL, and ITS, and the minimal age of both Begonia and the Begoniaceae were indirectly estimated. The analyses strongly support the placement of Hillebrandia as the sister group to the rest of the Begoniaceae and indicate that the Hillebrandia lineage is at least 51-65 million years old, an age that predates the current Hawaiian Islands by about 20 million years. Evidence that Hillebrandia sandwicensis has survived on the Hawaiian Archipelago by island hopping from older, now denuded islands to younger, more mountainous islands is presented. Various scenarios for the origin of ancestor to Hillebrandia are considered. The geographic origin of source populations unfortunately remains obscure; however, we suggest a boreotropic or a Malesian-Pacific origin is most likely. Hillebrandia represents the first example in the well-studied Hawaiian flora of a relict genus.},

The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, yet most of its evolutionary history is unknown. Diversification analyses, divergence time estimates and historical biogeography, illustrated that the extant species of Impatiens originated in Southwest China and started to diversify in the Early Miocene. Until the Early Pliocene, the net diversification rate within the genus was fairly slow. Since that time, however, approximately 80\% of all Impatiens lineages have originated. This period of rapid diversification coincides with the global cooling of the Earth's climate and subsequent glacial oscillations. Without this accelerated diversification rate, Impatiens would only have contained 1/5th of its current number of species, thereby indicating the rapid radiation of the genus.},

As a result, a large number of cloned AP3/DEF orthologues are available, which can be used for the design of taxon specific primers for phylogeny reconstruction of close relatives of the group of interest. Following this reasoning, we investigated the phylogenetic utility of the two AP3/DEF paralogues (ImpDEF1 and ImpDEF2) that were recently identified in the genus Impatiens (Balsaminaceae). K-domain introns 4 and 5 of both AP3/DEF duplicates were amplified and sequenced for 59 Impatiens species. Phylogenetic analyses of the separated and combined ImpDEF1 and ImpDEF2 data sets result in highly congruent topologies with the previously obtained chloroplast atpB-rbcL data set. Combination of chloroplast and nuclear matrices results in a well-supported evolutionary hypothesis of Impatiens. Our results show that introns 4 and 5 in AP3/DEF-like genes are a valuable source of characters for phylogenetic studies at the infrageneric level.},

B. japonica, B. yakushimensis, and B. laxiflora formed a well-supported clade that is distinct from other Balanophora. All three taxa also show considerable differences on morphological and nucleotide sequence differences, therefore the name of B. yakushimensis is retained. The results provide new insights on the intrageneric classification of Balanophora and suggest the positioning of female flowers should be down-weighted. We also successfully identify the hosts of B. japonica and B. yakushimensis by amplifying chloroplast matK sequences from the connected root tissues. The results showed that B. japonica parasitizes on Symplocos species, and that B. yakushimensis parasitizes on Distylium racemosum in Japan and Schima superba in Taiwan's population.},

Two haplotypes include both diploids and tetraploids; four others are all tetraploids. Based on the combination of these haplotypes and cytotypes, eight "haplo-cytotypes" can be defined, which show a distinct geographic structure. Two diploid haplo-cytotypes are distributed in the southwestern part and six tetraploid ones in the northeastern part of the Japanese archipelago. Diploid and tetraploid haplo-cytotypes with the same haplotype are, in one case, disjunctively distributed, and in another case, in contact. The phylogenetic relationships of haplo-cytotypes indicate that the traditional circumscription of A. japonica is paraphyletic. One lineage consists of four tetraploid haplo-cytotypes and another of diploid and tetraploid haplo-cytotypes plus A. chinensis. Tetraploidization occurred independently at least three times, once at the base of the former lineage and twice in the latter.

Despite progress in recent phylogenetic studies involving this genus, it still lacks a modern systematic and taxonomic update using integrative analyses of molecular and morphological evidence based on a broad species sampling. Here, we present, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genus to date based on a total-evidence approach, covering all formerly accepted segregates within the athyrioid ferns. We sampled up to eight plastid markers and 20 morphological characters for each species. Our analyses, including maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, yield a robust phylogenetic framework. We find that Athyrium is not monophyletic by recovering Athyrium skinneri and A. alpestre nested with Anisocampium and Cornopteris respectively while Pseudocystopteris is included in Athyrium. Furthermore, eight well-resolved clades and two isolated species within Athyrium are found in the phylogenetic topology, which can be also characterized by morphological synapomorphies from traits of petioles, leaves, sori and spores. In the interest of recognizing monophyletic taxa with morphological synapomorphies, we agree with the inclusion of Pseudocystopteris in Athyrium as proposed in previous studies, but treat Anisocampium and Cornopteris as separate genera. We further propose to resurrect a monotypic Pseudathyrium to accommodate A. alpestre. Based on morphological characters and molecular phylogeny, a new infrageneric classification system of Athyrium is proposed which subdivided it into ten sections, and one New-World species A. skinneri is transferred into Anisocampium.},

	abstract = {The wide geographical distribution of many fern species is related to their high dispersal ability. However, very limited studies surveyed biological traits that could contribute to colonization success after dispersal. In this study, we applied phylogenetic approaches to infer historical biogeography of the fern genus Deparia (Athyriaceae, Eupolypods II). Because polyploids are suggested to have better colonization abilities and are abundant in Deparia, we also examined whether polyploidy could be correlated to long-distance dispersal events and whether polyploidy could play a role in these dispersals/establishment and range expansion. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions were based on a four-region combined cpDNA dataset (rps16-matK IGS, trnL-L-F, matK and rbcL; a total of 4252 characters) generated from 50 ingroup (ca. 80\% of the species diversity) and 13 outgroup taxa. Using the same sequence alignment and maximum likelihood trees, we carried out molecular dating analyses. The resulting chronogram was used to reconstruct ancestral distribution using the DEC model and ancestral ploidy level using ChromEvol. We found that Deparia originated around 27.7Ma in continental Asia/East Asia. A vicariant speciation might account for the disjunctive distribution of East Asia-northeast North America. There were multiple independent long-distance dispersals to Africa/Madagascar (at least once), Southeast Asia (at least once), south Pacific islands (at least twice), Australia/New Guinea/New Zealand (at least once), and the Hawaiian Islands (at least once). In particular, the long-distance dispersal to the Hawaiian Islands was associated with polyploidization, and the dispersal rate was slightly higher in the polyploids than in diploids. Moreover, we found five species showing recent infraspecific range expansions, all of which took place concurrently with polyploidization. In conclusion, our study provides the first investigation using phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses trying to explore the link between historical biogeography and ploidy evolution in a fern genus and our results imply that polyploids might be better colonizers than diploids.},

	abstract = {For molecular phylogenetic reconstruction of some intrageneric groups of plants, a DNA region is needed that evolves more rapidly than the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) repeat. If the region identified is nuclear, it would also be desirable for it to undergo rapid concerted evolution to eliminate problems with coalescence. The external transcribed spacer (ETS) of the nrDNA repeat has shown promise for intrageneric phylogenetic reconstruction, but only the 3' end of the region has been utilized for phylogenetic reconstruction and "universal" primers for PCR amplification have been elusive. We present a method for reliably amplifying and sequencing the entire ETS throughout Asteraceae and some closely allied families. We also show that the ETS is more variable and phylogenetically informative than the ITS in three disparate genera of Asteraceae-Argyranthemum (tribe Anthemideae), Asteriscus (tribe Inuleae), and Helianthus (tribe Heliantheae). The full ETS was amplified using a primer (ETS1f) within the intergenic spacer in combination with a primer (18S-2L) in the 5' end of the highly conserved 18S gene. ETS1f was designed to correspond to a highly conserved region found in Helianthus and Crepis, which are in separate subfamilies of Asteraceae. ETS1f/18S-2L primed in all of the tribes of Asteraceae as well as exemplar taxa from Campanulaceae, Goodeniaceae, and Calyceraceae. For both Argyranthemum and Asteriscus, we were able to directly sequence the ETS PCR products when a single band was produced. When multiple bands were produced, we gel-purified and occasionally cloned the band of interest before sequencing. Although PCR produced single bands for Helianthus species, it was necessary to clone Helianthus amplifications prior to sequencing due to multiple intragenomic ETS repeat types. Alignment of ETS sequences for Argyranthemum and Asteriscus was straightforward and unambiguous despite some subrepeat structure in the 5' end. For Helianthus, different numbers of large tandem subrepeats in different species required analysis of the orthology of the subrepeats prior to alignment. In all three genera, the ETS provided more informative variation for phylogenetic reconstruction and allowed better resolution of relationships than the ITS. Although cloned sequences from Helianthus differed, intragenomic clones consistently formed clades. This result indicated that concerted evolution was proceeding rapidly enough in ETS that species-specific phylogenetic signal was retained. It should be now be possible to use the entire ETS for phylogenetic reconstruction of recently diverged lineages in Asteraceae and at least three other families (approximately 26,000 species or about 8\% of all angiosperms).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Changes in chromosome structure and number play an important role in plant evolution. A system well-suited to studying different modes of chromosome evolution is the genus Hypochaeris (Asteraceae) with its centre of species' diversity in South America. All South American species uniformly have a chromosome base number of x = 4 combined with variation in rDNA number and distribution, and a high frequency of polyploidy. The aim of this paper is to assess directions and mechanisms of karyotype evolution in South American species by interpreting both newly obtained and previous data concerning rDNA localization in a phylogenetic context. METHODS Eleven Hypochaeris species from 18 populations were studied using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 35S and 5S rDNA probes. A phylogenetic framework was established from neighbour-net analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprint data. KEY RESULTS A single 5S rDNA locus is invariably found on the short arm of chromosome 2. Using 35S rDNA loci, based on number (one or two) and localization (interstitial on the long arm of chromosome 2, but sometimes lacking, and terminal or interstitial on the short arm of chromosome 3, only very rarely lacking), seven karyotype groups can be distinguished; five of these include polyploids. Karyotype groups with more than one species do not form monophyletic groups. CONCLUSIONS Early evolution of Hypochaeris in South America was characterized by considerable karyotype differentiation resulting from independent derivations from an ancestral karyotype. There was marked diversification with respect to the position and evolution of the 35S rDNA locus on chromosome 3, probably involving inversions and/or transpositions, and on chromosome 2 (rarely 3) concerning inactivation and loss. Among these different karyotype assemblages, the apargioides group and its derivatives constitute by far the majority of species.},

	abstract = {Polyploidy, an important factor in eukaryotic evolution, is especially abundant in angiosperms, where it often acts in concert with hybridization to produce allopolyploids. The application of molecular phylogenetic techniques has identified the origins of numerous allopolyploids, but little is known on genomic and chromosomal consequences of allopolyploidization, despite their important role in conferring divergence of allopolyploids from their parental species. Here, using several plastid and nuclear sequence markers, we clarify the origin of tetra- and hexaploids in a group of American daisies, allowing characterization of genome dynamics in polyploids compared to their diploid ancestors. All polyploid species are allopolyploids. Among the four diploid gene pools, the propensity for allopolyploidization is unevenly distributed phylogenetically with a few species apparently more prone to participate, but the underlying causes remain unclear. Polyploid genomes are characterized by differential loss of ribosomal DNA loci (5S and 35S rDNA), known hotspots of chromosomal evolution, but show genome size additivity, suggesting limited changes beyond those affecting rDNA loci or the presence of processes counterbalancing genome reduction. Patterns of rDNA sequence conversion and provenance of the lost loci are highly idiosyncratic and differ even between allopolyploids of identical parentage, indicating that allopolyploids deriving from the same lower-ploid parental species can follow different evolutionary trajectories.},

There is support for monophyly of subtribes Chrysantheminae and Gonosperminae and for portions of some subtribes. However, our molecular phylogeny differs significantly from traditional classifications and from previously published morphological phylogenies of the tribe. Many South African genera from several different subtribes form a basal grade, indicating multiple, relictual lineages. Eurasian genera form a recently derived clade that includes the Mediterranean genera of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa.

Although the Antarctic flora was largely erased by glaciation during the Pleistocene, at least some Antarctic plant species found refuge on the subantarctic islands. METHODS We used independent and combined analyses of ITS, ETS, trnK, and trnL DNA sequences to infer phylogenetic relations in Pleurophyllum, a small genus of three species that are endemic to the subantarctic islands of Australia and New Zealand. The inferred phylogeny provided a framework to reconstruct the origin and patterns of diversification in the genus. KEY RESULTS We summarize support for the hypothesis that Pleurophyllum survived episodes of Pleistocene glaciation in the subantarctic islands and that its sisters dispersed northward in response to glacial advance. CONCLUSIONS The distinctive flora of the subantarctic islands includes some of the last remnants of a once-diverse Antarctic flora. These plants may still retain distinctive features of their ancestors. Studies of endemic plants such as Pleurophyllum are the key to resolving this puzzle.},

In this study we used two nuclear markers, the nrDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the low-copy nuclear gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), to resolve intergeneric and interspecific relationships within the subtribe at the diploid level, and to determine whether our phylogenies validate the classifications of Nesom or Semple. Our results confirm the distinct generic status of Canadanthus and Ampelaster, whereas Psilactis and Almutaster form a polytomy with Symphyotrichum. Within Symphyotrichum, subg. Virgulus is monophyletic based on ITS and appears polyphyletic based on GAPDH. Neither the ITS nor the GAPDH analyses support a distinct status for subg. Astropolium, which groups within subg.

Of nine species of Xylothamia, four species plus Gundlachia constitute one clade. The other five species are placed in a sister clade with several other genera including Amphiachyris, Bigelowia, Euthamia, Gutierrezia, and others. Except for X. johnstonii and X. palmeri, these five species of Xylothamia have little affinity for one another or for other genera in the same clade. Morphological similarities in foliar features between certain species in both lineages are possibly from a convergence resulting in adaptation to arid habitats. Such similarities were also the basis, in part, for their taxonomic treatment within Xylothamia or their earlier affiliation with Ericameria, which has similar features. The uncharacteristic leaf form in Xylothamia purpursii has a pattern of adaptation considerably different from its allies. Whether the Xylothamia-containing clades are related to Solidaginineae or represent an independently derived lineage remains equivocal because this outcome rested with the choice of data and optimality criteria.},

A biogeographic analysis supports the hypothesis of long-distance dispersal from NW Africa across the Atlantic Ocean for the origin of the South American taxa rather than migration from North America, through the Panamian land bridge, followed by subsequent extinction in North America. With the assumption of a molecular clock, the trans-Atlantic dispersal from NW Africa to South America is roughly estimated to have taken place during Pliocene or Pleistocene.},

The Asteraceae tribe Inuleae includes hermaphroditic, monoecious, dioecious, and gynomonoecious species. Gynomonoecy, the sexual system in which female and bisexual flowers occur on the same plant, is prevalent in the Asteraceae. We inferred one large gene phylogeny (ndhF) and two supertrees to investigate whether gynomonoecy was a stage in the evolution from hermaphroditism to monoecy. We identified transitions in sexual system evolution using the stochastic character mapping method. From gynomonoecious ancestors, both hermaphroditic and monoecious descendants have evolved. Gynomonoecy was not restricted to a stage in the evolution toward monoecy because the number of transitions and the rate of change from monoecy to gynomonoecy were much higher than the opposite. We also investigated one hypothesized association among female flowers and the development of a petaloid ray as an explanation of gynomonoecy maintenance in Asteraceae. We found that peripheral female flowers and petaloid rays were phylogenetically correlated. However, empirical evidence shows that a causal relationship between these traits is not clear.},

Vogt \& Oberp., one of the rarest flowering plant species of the Iberian Peninsula, two other unispecific genera (Hymenostemma, Prolongoa), and the polyploidy complex of the genus Leucanthemopsis belong. Based on sequence information from two single- to low-copy nuclear regions (C16, D35, characterised by Chapman et al. (2007)), the multi-copy region of the nrDNA internal transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2, and two intergenic spacer regions of the cpDNA gene trees were reconstructed using Bayesian inference methods. For the reconstruction of a multi-locus species tree we applied three different methods: (a) analysis of concatenated sequences using Bayesian inference (MrBayes), (b) a tree reconciliation approach by minimizing the number of deep coalescences (PhyloNet), and (c) a coalescent-based species-tree method in a Bayesian framework ((∗)BEAST). All three species tree reconstruction methods unequivocally support the close relationship of the subtribe with the hitherto unclassified genus Phalacrocarpum, the sister-group relationship of Castrilanthemum with the three remaining genera of the subtribe, and the further sister-group relationship of the clade of Hymenostemma+Prolongoa with a monophyletic genus Leucanthemopsis. Dating of the (∗)BEAST phylogeny supports the long-lasting (Early Miocene, 15-22Ma) taxonomical independence and the switch from the plesiomorphic perennial to the apomorphic annual life-form assumed for the Castrilanthemum lineage that may have occurred not earlier than in the Pliocene (3Ma) when the establishment of a Mediterranean climate with summer droughts triggered evolution towards annuality.},

A resolved phylogeny for the genus is essential for the advancement of these scientific areas. In the past, phylogenetic relationships of the perennial species and polyploid hybrids have been particularly difficult to resolve. Using the external transcribed spacer region of the nuclear 18S-26S rDNA region, we reveal for the first time a highly resolved gene tree for Helianthus. Phylogenetic analysis allowed the determination of a monophyletic annual H. sect. Helianthus, a two-lineage polyphyletic H. sect. Ciliares, and the monotypic H. sect. Agrestis, all of which were nested within a large perennial and polyphyletic H. sect. Divaricati. The distribution of perennial polyploids and known annual diploid hybrids on this phylogeny suggested multiple independent hybrid speciation events that gave rise to at least four polyploids and three diploid hybrids. Also provided by this phylogeny was evidence for homoploid hybrid speciation outside H. sect. Helianthus. Finally, previous hypotheses about the secondary chemistry in the genus were tested in a phylogenetic framework to obtain a better understanding of the evolution of these compounds in Helianthus.},

Each species is genetically distinct. Previous hypotheses of classification among these species into subgenera and sections, via morphological, phytochemical, isozymic and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) data, have been confirmed, except that R. saxatilis appears to be related to R. gayana rather than R. evenia. Analysis of phylogenetic results and biogeographic context suggests that five of these species have originated by cladogenesis and adaptive radiation on the older Robinson Crusoe Island. The sixth species, R. masafuerae, restricted to the younger Alejandro Selkirk Island, is closely related to and an anagenetic derivative of R. evenia from Robinson Crusoe. Microsatellite and AFLP data reveal considerable genetic variation among the cladogenetically derived species of Robinsonia, but within each the genetic variation is lower, highlighting presumptive genetic isolation and rapid radiation. The anagenetically derived R. masafuerae harbors a level of genetic variation similar to that of its progenitor, R. evenia. This is the first direct comparison of the genetic consequences of anagenetic and cladogenetic speciation in plants of an oceanic archipelago.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The geographic distribution of the genus Plectocephalus comprises a single species in Ethiopia, two in North America and possibly four more in South America, in a striking disjunction that is exceptional for genera of the tribe Cardueae. The enormity of this disjunction cast doubts on the precise taxonomic delineation of the genus, which is not unanimously recognized as a natural entity. The aims of this study were to define the generic boundaries of Plectocephalus and to formulate a hypothesis that would explain its natural range. METHODS A combined molecular approach, using nuclear internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and external transcribed spacers (ETS), and plastid trnL-trnL-F, rpl32-trnL(UAG) and ndhF markers, was chosen for phylogenetic reconstruction by maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. KEY RESULTS Phylogenetic analysis shows that Plectocephalus is a natural genus that includes the African species P. varians, together with all the native South American species, currently classified as Centaurea, C. cachinalensis, C. floccosa and C. tweediei. The recognition of Centaurodendron as an independent genus, which we consider appropriate, would make Plectocephalus paraphyletic. Affinities of Plectocephalus should lie with eastern representatives of Centaureinae. Geographic disjunction is explained as a consequence of dispersal via the Bering Land Bridge during the Miocene--Pliocene. The phylogeny of the basal grade of Centaureinae differs from previous phylogenies, and artefacts resulting from differences in mutation rates of annual and perennial taxa are confirmed. Sensitivity of ITS to these differences was the highest observed for all DNA regions used in this study. CONCLUSIONS The natural status of the genus Plectocephalus is confirmed and several nomenclatural combinations are proposed. New evidence contributes to the debate concerning problems posed by the use of ITS in the phylogenetic reconstruction of groups that differ in terms of their life cycles. Dispersal from Caucasus and Anatolia along the Siberian route and then across the Bering Land Bridge follows a route previously proposed for other taxonomic groups.},

This evidence, together with the presence of additive polymorphic sites in the Willkommia sequences which agree with the geographic distribution of the taxa, suggests that members of section Willkommia and the western Mediterranean taxa of sections Acrolophus and Phalolepis fit a reticulate evolution model.},

The root tip cells of the 12 accessions contained 24 chromosomes followed by 64, 44 and 20 chromosomes in 9, 6 and 2 accessions, respectively. Barring C. lanatus, the accessions within each taxon had the same zygotic number. The present results strongly support the view that the wild C. palaestinus (2n=24) and the cultivated C. tinctorius (2n=24) are closely related. With few exceptions, all DNA based dendrograms support three lineages within the genus. One lineage is constituted by C. arborescens (2n=24) alone. The present data indicates that because of unique composition of its nuclear genome vis-à-vis other Carthamus taxa, C. arborescens should be placed in a separate subgenus. The two remaining lineages, constituted by the taxa with 2n=24, and the taxa with 2n=20, 2n=44 and 2n=64, respectively should be given the rank of two taxonomic sections in the other subgenus. The present study also demonstrates that none of the present taxa with 2n=24 have contributed to the origin of polyploid taxa. Carthamus boisserii (2n=20) and C. glaucus ssp. anatolicus (2n=20) are more likely to be one of the diploid progenitor of C. lanatus ssp. creticus (2n=64), C. lanatus (2n=44), C. lanatus ssp. lanatus (2n=44) and C. lanatus ssp. montanus (2n=44), and C. lanatus ssp. turkestanicus (2n=64), respectively. Within Lanatus species complex, constituted by C. lanatus, C. lanatus ssp. lanatus, C. lanatus ssp. montanus, C. lanatus ssp. turkestanicus and C. lanatus ssp. creticus, high proportion of autapomorphic characters and low number of synapomorphies in the ITS and ETS sequences suggest a relatively recent diversification of the taxa within the species complex. Carthamus lanatus ssp. creticus (2n=64) and C. lanatus ssp. turkestanicus (2n=64) within the complex deserve species rank. This analysis provided evolutionary relatedness of the five unverified taxa with the known Carthamus taxa.},

	abstract = {Data from molecular phylogenetics were used to assess aspects of diversity and relationships in Brickellia, a large and widespread genus of Eupatorieae. The dataset included sequence data from nuclear ribosomal ITS, ETS, and plastid psbA-trnH regions. An initial question was to assess the monophyly of the genus and whether Barroetea, Phanerostylis, and Kuhnia should be recognized as separate from or included in Brickellia. The results supported the hypothesis that Brickellia is monophyletic, with the small (2-3 species) Pleurocoronis as the sister group and showed Barroetea, Phanerostylis, and Kuhnia all embedded within the genus. Results of a time calibrated phylogeny from a BEAST analysis gave an estimated origination time for Brickellia at about 9 million years ago (Ma), with the oldest split within the genus dated at about 7.5Ma. A BAMM analysis based on the time calibrated tree showed that Brickellia has one rate shift in diversification associated with its origin in the late Miocene. Some lineages within the genus have had an increase in the rate of diversification over the past 5Ma, whereas other lineages have had a decrease in net diversification during this period. The results also elucidated nine clades within Brickellia which are accepted as taxonomic sections, and that will form logical units for future detailed studies.},

Molecular phylogenetic data were sought to assess whether two monotypic genera, Garberia and Hartwrightia, are accurately placed in the subtribe, and to resolve questions of the generic-level classification of Carphephorus. Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ITS/ETS and plastid DNA data indicated that Garberia is the basalmost diverging lineage, and that Hartwrightia is phylogenetically embedded in the subtribe. There was significant incongruence between the ITS/ETS and plastid DNA datasets in the placement of Hartwrightia and another monotypic genus, Litrisa, suggesting that both are of original hybrid origin. The results also showed that Carphephorus s.l. is not monophyletic, and even after removal of the two species of Trilisa, it is still paraphyletic to Liatris. The apparent hybrid origin of Hartwrightia, which is morphologically transgressive relative to its inferred parental lineages, suggests that reticulation between phylogenetically distinct lineages may be a recurrent problem for phylogenetic estimation in Asteraceae.},

The ITS tree shows high resolution compared to that of the maternally inherited trnL intron, trnL/F spacer, and matK sequences. The ITS and the combined tree reveal clades that agree well with sections of the genus established previously on morphological and cytological grounds, except for H. robertia, which groups with Leontodon helveticus and L. autumnalis. Monophyly of species of Hypochaeris from South America is strongly supported by both ITS and the joint matrix of ITS, trnL, and matK data. European species lie basal to South American taxa, which suggests that species in South America evolved from a single introduction from European progenitors and not from H. robertia as suggested previously. Low levels of sequence divergence among South American taxa suggest a pattern of rapid speciation, in contrast to much greater divergence among European representatives. Different species of Leontodon form two different clades that are also supported by chromosome numbers and morphology. Both nuclear and chloroplast markers suggest that Helminthotheca, Leontodon, and Picris are closely related to each other as well as to Hypochaeris.},

The two species native to Europe, L. alpinum (known as the common 'Edelweiss') and L. nivale, are part of the cultural heritage of the people living there. Despite its importance, very little is known about the systematics of the genus. Because recent molecular studies have shown that species within this genus are closely related and difficult to distinguish with rDNA and cpDNA data, we used AFLPs to obtain a more detailed understanding of the phylogeny of the genus. Our main aims were as follows: (1) to clarify species relationships within the genus; and (2) to reveal information about the biogeography of the genus. We used AFLPs with six primer combinations to investigate 216 individuals in 38 populations of 16 different species. With AFLPs, we were able to recognize 10 different groups, all of which had strong bootstrap support. These results were also congruent with the morphology-based taxonomy of the genus. Most private and rare fragments were found in the Yunnan region (south-western China) relative to Europe and Mongolia/central China, suggesting a long-lasting in situ history of populations in the centre of diversity of the genus. Our results illustrate the utility of AFLPs to resolve phylogenetic relationships between these closely related species.},

	abstract = {The remarkable diversity of Eupatorieae in the Brazilian flora has received little study, despite the tribe's very high levels of endemism and importance in the threatened Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspots. Eupatorieae are one of the largest tribes in Asteraceae with 14 of 19 recognized subtribes occurring in Brazil. We constructed the largest phylogeny of Brazilian Eupatorieae to date that sampled the nrITS and ETS, chloroplast ndhI and ndhF genes, and the ndhI-ndhG intergenic spacer for 183 species representing 77 of the 85 Brazilian genera of the tribe. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses showed that these species are not collectively monophyletic, so their distribution reflects multiple introductions into Brazil. A novel clade was found that includes 75\% of the genera endemic to Brazil (Cerrado-Atlantic Forest Eupatorieae, "CAFE" clade). This radiation of at least 247 species concentrated in the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes of central eastern Brazil is {\textless}7 my old and exhibits several ecologically diverse life forms. Eight subtribes of Brazilian Eupatorieae (Ageratinae, Alomiinae, Ayapaninae, Critoniinae, Disynaphiinae, Eupatoriinae, Gyptidinae and Hebecliniinae) and 16 genera (Ageratum, Agrianthus, Austroeupatorium, Bejaranoa, Chromolaena, Critonia, Disynaphia, Grazielia, Hatschbachiella, Heterocondylus, Koanophyllon, Lasiolaena, Neocabreria, Praxelis, Stylotrichium, and Symphyopappus) were found to be polyphyletic. We attribute incongruities between the molecular phylogenetic results and the current classification of the tribe mostly to convergent evolution of morphological characters traditionally used in the classification of the tribe.

	abstract = {Artemisia is the largest genus (ca. 350-500+ spp.) in the tribe Anthemideae and is composed of ecologically, morphologically, and chemically diverse species that are found primarily throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Two major centers of diversity for the genus are located in Eurasia and western North America, but phytogeographic links connecting these two regions are observed all across the North Pacific Rim and adjacent areas in the Arctic, including many islands and archipelagos. Previous phylogenetic studies have helped to clarify major lineages and identify likely sister relationships, but many questions remain unanswered regarding the relationships and migration history of New and Old World species. Here we investigate the phylogenetics of Artemisia within a biogeographic context centered in the Beringian Region and offer new hypotheses concerning species relationships, migration history, and the likely role of reticulate evolution in the genus. Our sampling included many new taxa and emphasized multiple accessions of widespread species, species from proposed refugia, and species with disjunct/vicariant distributions. The ITS phylogeny contained 173 accessions (94 new and 79 from GenBank) and indicated that Artemisia is paraphyletic by the exclusion of several small Asian genera and the North American genus Sphaeromeria. Following a survey of thirteen chloroplast loci, phylogenies based on two plastid markers (psbA-trnH and rpl32-trnL spacers) were constructed with a reduced data set, and though largely consistent with the ITS topology, revealed several cases of possible introgression among New World and Beringian species. Our analysis reveals that North American Artemisia species have multiple origins, and that western North America has served as a source for some colonizing elements in eastern Asia and South America.},

Gene phylogenies based on maximum parsimony analyses reveal that the Espeletiinae clade is nested well within the subtribe Melampodiinae and thus should be considered a monophyletic complex of species, not a separate subtribe. The most parsimonious gene trees suggest that the genus Ichthyothere may be the sister taxon to the Espeletia complex and that the genus Smallanthus and a species of Rumfordia are likely among the complex's other closest living relatives.

This study presents a detailed analysis of incongruent patterns between plastid and ITS/ETS phylogenies of Tribe Senecioneae (Asteraceae). This approach revealed widespread and strongly supported incongruence, which complicates conclusions about evolutionary relationships at all taxonomic levels. The patterns of incongruence that were resolved suggest that incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and/or ancient hybridization are the most likely explanations. These phenomena are, however, extremely difficult to distinguish because they may result in similar phylogenetic patterns. We present a novel approach to evaluate whether ILS can be excluded as an explanation for incongruent patterns. This coalescence-based method uses molecular dating estimates of the duration of the putative ILS events to determine if invoking ILS as an explanation for incongruence would require unrealistically high effective population sizes. For four of the incongruent patterns identified within the Senecioneae, this approach indicates that ILS cannot be invoked to explain the observed incongruence. Alternatively, these patterns are more realistically explained by ancient hybridization events.},

Five of these lineages heretofore had been circumscribed in tribe Mutisieae (Cichorioideae), a taxon shown by earlier molecular studies to be paraphyletic and to include some of the deepest divergences of the family. Combined analyses of 10 chloroplast DNA loci by different phylogenetic methods yielded highly congruent well-resolved trees with 95\% of the branches receiving moderate to strong statistical support. Our strategy of sampling genera identified by morphological studies as anomalous, supported by broader character sampling than previous studies, resulted in identification of several novel clades. The generic compositions of subfamilies Carduoideae, Gochnatioideae, Hecastocleidoideae, Mutisioideae, Pertyoideae, Stifftioideae, and Wunderlichioideae are novel in Asteraceae systematics and the taxonomy of the family has been revised to reflect only monophyletic groups. Our results contradict earlier hypotheses that early divergences in the family took place on and spread from the Guayana Highlands (Pantepui Province of northern South America) and raise new hypotheses about how Asteraceae dispersed out of the continent of their origin. Several nodes of this new phylogeny illustrate the vast differential in success of sister lineages suggesting focal points for future study of species diversification.

Ancestral state reconstruction of ten morphological characters at the root node of the Asteraceae showed that the ancestral sunflower would have had a woody habit, alternate leaves, solitary capitulescences, epaleate receptacles, smooth styles, smooth to microechinate pollen surface sculpturing, white to yellow corollas, and insect-mediated pollination. Herbaceous habit, echinate pollen surface, pubescent styles, and cymose capitulescences were reconstructed for backbone nodes of the phylogeny corresponding to clades that evolved shortly after Asteraceae dispersed out of South America. No support was found for discoid capitula, multiseriate involucres or bird pollination as the ancestral character condition for any node. Using this more resolved phylogenetic tree, the recently described Raiguenrayun cura+Mutisiapollis telleriae fossil should be associated to a more derived node than previously suggested when time calibrating phylogenies of Asteraceae.},

Another species group comprising C. thespidioides (Desert Sneezeweed), C. cunninghamii (Old man weed, or Common sneeze-weed), C. crateriformis is well-supported but then include the morphologically aberrant C. aotearoana, all sharing the character of having capitula that mature more slowly relative the subtending shoot.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Farfugium (Asteraceae) is a small genus that contains the two species F. japonicum and F. hiberniflorum and is distributed along a long archipelago in east Asia. The common taxon, F. japonicum, includes three varieties associated with a wide range of habitats, including forest understorey (sciophytes), coastal crag (heliophytes) and riverbed (rheophytes). Leaf shape is an important taxonomic character within this genus and is associated with the habitat. METHODS Twenty populations that included all Farfugium taxa were collected throughout its range. Leaf morphology was measured to determine differences amongst the taxa. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the internal transcribed spacer of nuclear rDNA and four plastid DNA regions (matK, trnL-trnF, trnH-psbA and rpl20-rps12) were conducted separately. KEY RESULTS Leaf morphology was significantly different amongst taxa, but morphological variations were partly explained by adaptation to certain environmental conditions that each population inhabited. Molecular phylogenies for the nDNA internal transcribed spacer and cpDNA were consistent in classifying F. hiberniflorum and the Taiwanese var. formosanum, whilst suggesting polyphyletic origins for the rheophyte, sciophyte and heliophyte taxa. All samples from the southern Ryukyus (Japan) and Taiwan clustered into a monophyletic group, which corroborates the land configuration theory involving Quaternary land-bridge formation and subsequent fragmentation into islands. The incongruence between the two DNA datasets may imply traces of introgressive hybridization and/or incomplete lineage sorting. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of rheophyte, sciophyte and heliophyte plants within Farfugium may be attributable to their isolation on islands and subsequent adaptation to the riparian, coastal crag and forest understorey environments, following their migration over the Quaternary land-bridge formation along their distribution range. Nearly identical DNA sequences coupled with highly divergent morphologies amongst these taxa suggest that diversification was rapid.},

	abstract = {Anaphalis is the largest Asian genus in the tribe Gnaphalieae (Asteraceae) and has its greatest species diversity in the eastern Himalayas. The nuclear internal and external transcribed spacers were sequenced for Anaphalis species, with an emphasis on the eastern Himalayan taxa to examine the monophyly and construct the phylogenetic relationships of and within the genus. The results suggest that all species of Anaphalis are nested with Helichrysum, showing a close relationship with a Mediterranean-Asian group of Helichrysum. Although the monophyly of Anaphalis is only weakly supported, two clades within the genus are well recognized, each consisting of two subgroups. The inferred phylogenetic relationships within Anaphalis correspond to the shape of leaf base, rather than the morphology of the capitula and phyllaries that are usually used for species delimitation and classification in the genus. All four subgroups of Anaphalis are common and diversified in the eastern Himalayas with multiple dispersals out of this region. The sole North American species of Anaphalis is best hypothesized to be the result of long-distance dispersal or overland migration via Bering land bridge from Asia. Our analyses suggest that the extant distribution of Anaphalis has most likely resulted one radiation into the eastern Himalayas followed by repeated independent dispersals and/or radiations mostly into eastern Asia but also into the western Himalayas, North America, and southeast Asia.},

The objective of this study was to make progress toward meeting these requirements in the evolutionarily complex subtribe Machaerantherinae. The 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) spacer was investigated to characterize its structure and variation. Analysis of the spacer supported relationships that were mostly the same as those supported by ITS and ETS sequence data. Two methods were used to estimate support for 11 occurrences of incongruence between 5S/ITS/ETS and cpDNA data sets. The five best-supported incongruences were proposed to have had reticulate evolutionary histories. For Arida blepharophylla, Xanthisma rhizomatum, and Pyrrocoma, 5S and ITS/ETS evidence supported the same or similar relationships, indicating that these two regions of the nuclear genome were descended from the same ancestor or from two closely related ancestors, with cpDNA coming from a more distantly related ancestor. The 5S and ITS/ETS evidence disagreed on the relationships of Arida riparia, suggesting that its ITS/ETS region came from one ancestor and its 5S region and cpDNA from a different ancestor.},

All but two of these species develop woody stems by maturity. Chloroplast DNA restriction site variation was analyzed for all species of Tolpis and four outgroups in order to understand the patterns of island colonization and evolution of woodiness in this genus. Parsimony analyses revealed a strongly supported monophyletic Tolpis. Within the genus, the following three well-supported groups were detected: all species from the Canary Islands and Cape Verde Islands, both Azorean species, and both continental species. The Canary Island/Cape Verde clade was sister to the two continental species, and the Azorean clade was sister to this group. The two Madeiran species of Tolpis occupied the basalmost positions within the genus. When biogeography was mapped onto this phylogeny, nine equally parsimonious reconstructions (five steps each) of dispersal history were detected, which fell into two groups: eight reconstructions implied that Tolpis colonized Madeira from the continent, followed by continental extinction and subsequent continental recolonization, while one reconstruction implied that Tolpis colonized Macaronesia four times. Two of the reconstructions involving continental extinction required the least amount of overall dispersal distance. The cpDNA phylogeny also suggests that woodiness arose in the common ancestor of all extant Tolpis, followed by two independent reversals to an herbaceous habit. Assuming that one of the eight reconstructions favoring continental extinction and recolonization is true, our results suggest that Tolpis may represent the first documented example of a woody plant group in Macaronesia that has recolonized the mainland in herbaceous form.},

One group of Wyethia species, including all members of sections Alarconia and Wyethia as well as W. bolanderi from section Agnorhiza, is monophyletic and sister to Balsamorhiza.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Understanding demographic histories, such as divergence time, patterns of gene flow, and population size changes, in ecologically diverging lineages provide implications for the process and maintenance of population differentiation by ecological adaptation. This study addressed the demographic histories in two independently derived lineages of flood-resistant riparian plants and their non-riparian relatives [Ainsliaea linearis (riparian) and A. apiculata (non-riparian); A. oblonga (riparian) and A. macroclinidioides (non-riparian); Asteraceae] using an isolation-with-migration (IM) model based on variation at 10 nuclear DNA loci. RESULTS The highest posterior probabilities of the divergence time parameters were estimated to be ca. 25,000 years ago for A. linearis and A. apiculata and ca. 9000 years ago for A. oblonga and A. macroclinidioides, although the confidence intervals of the parameters had broad ranges. The likelihood ratio tests detected evidence of historical gene flow between both riparian/non-riparian species pairs. The riparian populations showed lower levels of genetic diversity and a significant reduction in effective population sizes compared to the non-riparian populations and their ancestral populations. CONCLUSIONS This study showed the recent origins of flood-resistant riparian plants, which are remarkable examples of plant ecological adaptation. The recent divergence and genetic signatures of historical gene flow among riparian/non-riparian species implied that they underwent morphological and ecological differentiation within short evolutionary timescales and have maintained their species boundaries in the face of gene flow. Comparative analyses of adaptive divergence in two sets of riparian/non-riparian lineages suggested that strong natural selection by flooding had frequently reduced the genetic diversity and size of riparian populations through genetic drift, possibly leading to fixation of adaptive traits in riparian populations. The two sets of riparian/non-riparian lineages showed contrasting patterns of gene flow and genetic differentiation, implying that each lineage showed different degrees of reproductive isolation and that they had experienced unique evolutionary and demographic histories in the process of adaptive divergence.},

However, knowledge of its floristic evolution is fairly limited. The genus Ainsliaea is endemic to and distributed throughout the Sino-Japanese region. Its interspecific phylogenetic relationships have not been resolved. The aim is to provide insight into floristic evolution in eastern Asia on the basis of a molecular phylogenetic analysis of Ainsliaea species. METHODS Cladistic analyses of the sequences of two nuclear (ITS, ETS) and one plastid (ndhF) regions were carried out individually and using the combined data from the three markers. KEY RESULTS Phylogenetic analyses of three DNA regions confirmed that Ainsliaea is composed of three major clades that correspond to species distributions. Evolution of the three lineages was estimated to have occurred around 1.1 MYA during the early Pleistocene. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that Ainsliaea species evolved allopatrically and that the descendants were isolated in the eastern (between SE China and Japan, through Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands) and western (Yunnan Province and its surrounding areas, including the Himalayas, the temperate region of Southeast Asia, and Sichuan Province) sides of the Sino-Japanese region. The results suggest that two distinct lineages of Ainsliaea have independently evolved in environmentally heterogeneous regions within the Sino-Japanese region. These regions have maintained rich and original floras due to their diverse climates and topographies.},

Each data set was analyzed separately and in combination using maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. The phylogeny of Flaveria is based on the combined analysis of all data. Our phylogenetic evidence indicates that C(3) Flaveria are all basal to intermediate (C(3)-C(4) and C(4)-like) and fully expressed C(4) Flaveria species. Two strongly supported clades (A and B) are present. Using this phylogeny, we evaluate the current systematics of the genus and suggest the removal and reevaluation of certain taxa. We also infer the center of origin and dispersal of Flaveria species. Multiple origins of photosynthetic pathway intermediacy in Flaveria are recognized. C(3)-C(4) intermediacy has evolved twice in the genus and is found to be evolutionarily intermediate in clade A, but not necessarily in clade B. C(4)-like photosynthesis is also derived once in each clade. In addition, fully expressed C(4) photosynthesis may have evolved up to three times within clade A.},

This paper presents a phylogenetic framework for subtribe Arctotidinae, which have a southern and eastern African-Australian distribution centered in the winter-rainfall region of South Africa. DNA sequence data from five chloroplast fragments (ndhF, psbA-trnH, rps16, trnS-trnfM, and trnT-trnF) and the nuclear ITS region were analyzed separately and in combination using parsimony and Bayesian methods. The data sets comprised exemplars from 18 ingroup species, representing the five currently accepted genera, and four outgroup species from Gorteriinae. All analyses indicated Arctotis and Haplocarpha are polyphyletic as presently circumscribed. The Australian-endemic Cymbonotus lawsonianus was placed within a strongly supported clade also containing A. arctotoides from South Africa and H. schimperi from eastern Africa. Retention of Dymondia and resurrection of Landtia at generic level are strongly supported. The phylogenetic hypotheses indicate the subtribe might have originated in temperate southern or eastern Africa, or it was ancestrally widespread in southern Africa and has diversified vicariously. The derived placement of C. lawsonianus indicates long-distance dispersal from southern Africa to Australia occurred.},

Eight well-supported major lineages were resolved. The earliest-diverging extant lineages are afromontane or inhabit mesic habitats, whereas almost all sampled taxa from the winter-rainfall and semi-arid areas have diverged more recently.

	abstract = {The leaf economics spectrum (LES) describes a major axis of plant functional trait variation worldwide, defining suites of leaf traits aligned with resource-acquisitive to resource-conservative ecological strategies. The LES has been interpreted to arise from leaf-level trade-offs among ecophysiological traits common to all plants. However, it has been suggested that the defining leaf-level trade-offs of the LES may not hold within specific functional groups (e.g., herbs) nor within many groups of closely related species, which challenges the usefulness of the LES paradigm across evolutionary scales. Here, we examine the evolution of the LES across 28 species of the diverse herbaceous genus Helianthus (the sunflowers), which occupies a wide range of habitats and climate variation across North America. Using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we find repeated evolution of more resource-acquisitive LES strategies in cooler, drier, and more fertile environments. We also find macroevolutionary correlations among LES traits that recapitulate aspects of the global LES, but with one major difference: leaf mass per area is uncorrelated with leaf lifespan. This indicates that whole-plant processes likely drive variation in leaf lifespan across Helianthus, rather than leaf-level trade-offs. These results suggest that LES patterns do not reflect universal physiological trade-offs at small evolutionary scales.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Tragopogon mirus and T. miscellus are allotetraploids (2n = 24) that formed repeatedly during the past 80 years in eastern Washington and adjacent Idaho (USA) following the introduction of the diploids T. dubius, T. porrifolius, and T. pratensis (2n = 12) from Europe. In most natural populations of T. mirus and T. miscellus, there are far fewer 35S rRNA genes (rDNA) of T. dubius than there are of the other diploid parent (T. porrifolius or T. pratensis). We studied the inheritance of parental rDNA loci in allotetraploids resynthesized from diploid accessions. We investigate the dynamics and directionality of these rDNA losses, as well as the contribution of gene copy number variation in the parental diploids to rDNA variation in the derived tetraploids. RESULTS Using Southern blot hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we analyzed copy numbers and distribution of these highly reiterated genes in seven lines of synthetic T. mirus (110 individuals) and four lines of synthetic T. miscellus (71 individuals). Variation among diploid parents accounted for most of the observed gene imbalances detected in F1 hybrids but cannot explain frequent deviations from repeat additivity seen in the allotetraploid lines. Polyploid lineages involving the same diploid parents differed in rDNA genotype, indicating that conditions immediately following genome doubling are crucial for rDNA changes. About 19\% of the resynthesized allotetraploid individuals had equal rDNA contributions from the diploid parents, 74\% were skewed towards either T. porrifolius or T. pratensis-type units, and only 7\% had more rDNA copies of T. dubius-origin compared to the other two parents. Similar genotype frequencies were observed among natural populations. Despite directional reduction of units, the additivity of 35S rDNA locus number is maintained in 82\% of the synthetic lines and in all natural allotetraploids. CONCLUSIONS Uniparental reductions of homeologous rRNA gene copies occurred in both synthetic and natural populations of Tragopogon allopolyploids. The extent of these rDNA changes was generally higher in natural populations than in the synthetic lines. We hypothesize that locus-specific and chromosomal changes in early generations of allopolyploids may influence patterns of rDNA evolution in later generations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The genus Flaveria has been extensively used as a model to study the evolution of C4 photosynthesis as it contains C3 and C4 species as well as a number of species that exhibit intermediate types of photosynthesis. The current phylogenetic tree of the genus Flaveria contains 21 of the 23 known Flaveria species and has been previously constructed using a combination of morphological data and three non-coding DNA sequences (nuclear encoded ETS, ITS and chloroplast encoded trnL-F). RESULTS Here we developed a new strategy to update the phylogenetic tree of 16 Flaveria species based on RNA-Seq data. The updated phylogeny is largely congruent with the previously published tree but with some modifications. We propose that the data collection method provided in this study can be used as a generic method for phylogenetic tree reconstruction if the target species has no genomic information. We also showed that a "F. pringlei" genotype recently used in a number of labs may be a hybrid between F. pringlei (C3) and F. angustifolia (C3-C4). CONCLUSIONS We propose that the new strategy of obtaining phylogenetic sequences outlined in this study can be used to construct robust trees in a larger number of taxa. The updated Flaveria phylogenetic tree also supports a hypothesis of stepwise and parallel evolution of C4 photosynthesis in the Flavaria clade.},

	abstract = {Mountains of continental Greece are one of the main Mediterranean biodiversity hotspots, very rich in endemic species. The speciation in this area might have resulted from two main factors: a complex orography and its role as a refugium during past glaciations. We have investigated genetic diversity and population structure for a group of narrow endemics of Centaurea subsect. Phalolepis, with three main goals: to investigate population structure of these narrow endemics, to check whether patterns of genetic variation are in agreement with recognized species boundaries, and to get insights into the process of diversification within this group. Fifteen populations belonging to seven species were genotyped using cpDNA (rpl32-trnL region) sequences and nuclear microsatellites (eight loci). SSR were used to assess genetic variability, to analyse molecular variance, to identify genetic barriers, to estimate recent and historical gene flow, and to carry out a model-based Bayesian clustering. Analysis of cpDNA was used to construct a haplotype network. Despite being narrow endemics, all the studied species show moderate to high SSR genetic diversity. Genetic isolation of populations is very high, with no current gene flow among them. Patterns of genetic structure indicate that there are more genetic clusters than there are currently recognized taxa. Genetic data suggest that isolation in mountain ranges and subsequent allopatric speciation would be the main driver of diversification in the group; the refugial nature of the mountains of continental Greece has allowed the maintenance of high within-population genetic diversity.},

	abstract = {The Ligularia-Cremanthodium-Parasenecio (L-C-P) complex of the Tussilagininae (Asteraceae: Senecioneae) contains more than 200 species that are endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in eastern Asia. These species are morphologically distinct; however, their relationships appear complex. A phylogenetic analysis of members of the complex and selected taxa of the tribe Senecioneae was conducted using chloroplast (ndhF and trnL-F) and nuclear (ITS) sequences. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from individual and combined datasets of the three different sequences. All analyses suggested that Doronicum, a genus that has been included in the Tussilagininae, should be excluded from this subtribe and placed at the base of the tribe Senecioneae. In addition, the Tussilagininae should be broadly circumscribed to include the Tephroseridinae. Within the expanded Tussilagininae containing all 13 genera occurring in eastern Asia, Tussilago and Petasites diverged early as a separate lineage, while the remaining 11 genera comprise an expanded L-C-P complex clade. We suggest that the L-C-P clade, which is largely unresolved, most likely originated as a consequence of an explosive radiation. The few monophyletic subclades identified in the L-C-P clade with robust support further suggest that some genera of Tussilagininae from eastern Asia require generic re-circumscriptions given the occurrence of subclades containing species of the same genus in different parts of the phylogentic tree due to homoplasy of important morphological characters used to delimit them. Molecular-clock analyses suggest that the explosive radiation of the L-C-P complex occurred mostly within the last 20 million years, which falls well within the period of recent major uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau between the early Miocene to the Pleistocene. It is proposed that significant increases in geological and ecological diversity that accompanied such uplifting, most likely promoted rapid and continuous allopatric speciation in small and isolated populations, and allowed fixation or acquisition of similar morphological characters within unrelated lineages. This phenomenon, possibly combined with interspecific diploid hybridization because of secondary sympatry during relatively stable stages between different uplifts, could be a major cause of high species diversity in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas of eastern Asia.},

Some taxonomists adopt a broad definition of EA Aster, whereas others favour a narrow generic concept. The present study aims to delimit EA Aster sensu stricto (s.s.), elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of EA Aster s.s. and segregate genera. METHODS The internal and external transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the plastid DNA trnL-F region were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of EA Aster through maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. KEY RESULTS The analyses strongly support an Aster clade including the genera Sheareria, Rhynchospermum, Kalimeris (excluding Kalimeris longipetiolata), Heteropappus, Miyamayomena, Turczaninowia, Rhinactinidia, eastern Asian Doellingeria, Asterothamnus and Arctogeron. Many well-recognized species of Chinese Aster s.s. lie outside of the Aster clade. CONCLUSIONS The results reveal that EA Aster s.s. is both paraphyletic and polyphyletic. Sheareria, Rhynchospermum, Kalimeris (excluding K. longipetiolata), Heteropappus, Miyamayomena, Turczaninowia, Rhinactinidia, eastern Asian Doellingeria, Asterothamnus and Arctogeron should be included in Aster, whereas many species of Chinese Aster s.s. should be excluded. The recircumscribed Aster should be divided into two subgenera and nine sections. Kalimeris longipetiolata, Aster batangensis, A. ser. Albescentes, A. series Hersileoides, a two-species group composed of A. senecioides and A. fuscescens, and a six-species group including A. asteroides, should be elevated to generic level. With the Aster clade, they belong to the Australasian lineages. The generic status of Callistephus should be maintained. Whether Galatella (including Crinitina) and Tripolium should remain as genera or be merged into a single genus remains to be determined. In addition, the taxonomic status of A. auriculatus and the A. pycnophyllus-A. panduratus clade remains unresolved, and the systematic position of some segregates of EA Aster requires further study.},

Without these two taxa, Stephanomeria is a well-supported (100\% bootstrap), monophyletic group of ten perennial and six annual species. Munzothamnus blairii and Pleiacanthus spinosus, both now considered members of monotypic genera, had been placed in Stephanomeria primarily because they have the same chromosome number as Stephanomeria and similar pollen surface features, but many disparities were ignored in previous classifications. Within Stephanomeria, an unsuspected sister relationship was detected between the montane S. lactucina and coastal S. cichoriacea. A second clade contained all the annual taxa and five of the perennial species. Among the annuals, strong bootstrap support was obtained for the previously recognized relationships between S. diegensis and S. exigua (98\%) and between S. malheurensis and its progenitor, S. exigua subsp. coronaria (96\%). Among the five perennial species that constitute a clade with the annuals, the recently described S. fluminea was shown to be sister to S. runcinata, and both of them were closely allied to S. tenuifolia and S. thurberi. The clade including the annuals (and five of the perennial species) was subtended by perennial lineages and pairwise divergence values among the annual taxa were much lower than among the perennial taxa as a group (though not too different than among the perennials in the same clade). The annuals probably originated recently within the genus.},

The cpDNA phylogeny is not well resolved in the core members of the alliance (i.e., subg. Dendrosonchus and genus Taeckholmia), but like the ITS tree, it has identified basal lineages of monotypic genera. The cpDNA data set was not significantly different from that of ITS, and subsequent combined analysis provided a better resolved and supported phylogeny within the alliance. The combined ML tree identified the same basal lineages, suggested nonmonophyly of Dendrosonchus and Taeckholmia, and did not support either Boulos' or Aldridge's infrasubgeneric classification system. Assessment of the role of hybridization and introgression was limited due to poor resolution in the cpDNA phylogeny.

	abstract = {We examined the evolutionary history of the diploid representatives of the genus Leucanthemum Mill. (Compositae, Anthemideae), which constitutes an extensive polyploid complex comprising around 41 species with ploidy levels ranging from 2x to 22x. The inference of phylogenetic relationships even on the diploid level is complicated in this genus due to the overlay of hybridisation and incomplete lineage sorting processes leading to incongruence among gene trees based on nuclear and plastid sequence information. Species tree and network reconstructions were based on gene trees from nine low-copy nuclear markers and the concatenated sequence information for five intergenic spacer regions of the chloroplast genome, either sequenced by Roche 454 pyrosequencing techniques or traditional Sanger sequencing techniques. Additional phylogenetic information came from multi-locus AFLP-fingerprinting of representative individuals of all diploid taxa under study and the subsequent analysis of AFLP patterns with Bayesian clustering and network reconstruction methods. To distinguish between hybridisation and incomplete lineage sorting, we developed and utilized a new 'hybrid index' calculation for individual taxa of the data set, which was compared to a simulated null-distribution assuming the occurrence of incomplete lineage sorting alone for pinpointing taxa with a significant hybrid signal. As a result, two species groups with contrasting patterns of gene flow and/or hybrid speciation signals could be identified in the diploids of Leucanthemum: (a) an early-diverging stock of allopatrically distributed diploid species with a lack of evidence for recent hybridisation events among its members and (b) a more recently radiated taxon assemblage with morphologically less clearly circumscribed taxa and a pronounced signal of gene flow among lineages and several candidate taxa, for which a homoploid hybrid origin may be considered.},

Recent molecular phylogenies have also indicated that some Coreopsideae genera are not monophyletic. We used internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences from representatives of 19 genera, as well as all major lineages in those genera that are not monophyletic, to examine phylogenetic relationships within this group. To examine the affects of alignment and method of analysis on our conclusions, we obtained alignments using five different parameters and analyzed all five alignments with distance, parsimony, and Bayesian methods. The method of analysis had a larger impact on relationships than did alignments, although different analytical methods gave very similar results. Although not all relationships could be resolved, a number of well-supported lineages were found, some in conflict with earlier hypotheses. We did not find monophyly in Bidens, Coreopsis, and Coreocarpus, though other genera were monophyletic for the taxa we included. Morphological and anatomical traits which have been used previously to resolve phylogenetic relationships in this group were mapped onto the well-supported nodes of the ITS phylogeny. This analysis indicated that floral and fruit characters, which have been used extensively in phylogenetic studies in the Coreopsideae, show a higher degree of evolutionary lability in this group than the more highly conserved vegetative and photosynthetic traits.},

Two genera, Reichardia and Launaea, diverge first, followed by a major radiation of the remaining species, including Dendroseris and Thamnoseris. The monotypic Aetheorhiza is more closely related to Sonchus than to Launaea. Sonchus is highly polyphyletic, occurring across nearly all clades of the trees. It is highly probable that several Pacific and Atlantic island endemics evolved within the Sonchus group. Polyploidization processes appear to have played an important role in evolutionary differentiation and speciation in Sonchus, especially in subgenus Sonchus.

	abstract = {The Vernonieae is one of the major tribes of the largest family of flowering plants, the sunflower family (Compositae or Asteraceae), with ca. 25,000 species. While the family's basal members (the Barnadesioideae) are found in South America, the tribe Vernonieae originated in the area of southern Africa/Madagascar. Its sister tribe, the Liabeae, is New World, however. This is the only such New/Old World sister tribe pairing anywhere in the family. The Vernonieae is now found on islands and continents worldwide and includes more than 1500 taxa. The Vernonieae has been called the "evil tribe" because overlapping character states make taxonomic delimitations difficult at all levels from the species to the subtribe for the majority of taxa. Juxtaposed with these difficult-to-separate entities are monotypic genera with highly distinctive morphologies and no obvious affinities to any other members of the tribe. The taxonomic frustration generated by these contrary circumstances has resulted in a lack of any phylogeny for the tribe until now. A combined approach using DNA sequence data from two chloroplast regions, the ndhF gene and the noncoding spacer trnL-F, and from the nuclear rDNA ITS region for 90 taxa from throughout the world was used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the tribe. The data were analyzed separately and in combination using maximum parsimony (MP), minimum evolution neighbor-joining (NJ), and Bayesian analysis, the latter producing the best resolved and most strongly supported tree. In general, the phylogeny shows Old World taxa to be basal and New World taxa to be derived, but this is not always the case. Old and New World species are found together in two separate and only distantly related clades. This is best explained by long-distance dispersal with a minimum of two trans-oceanic exchanges. Meso/Central America has had an important role in ancient dispersals between the Old and New World and more recent movements from South to North America in the New World.},

The aggregation of heads into higher-order capitulescences (secondary heads or syncephalia) is considered evolutionarily advanced. The genera Moscharia, Nassauvia, Polyachyrus, and Triptilion of the subtribe Nassauviinae (Mutisieae) have syncephalia with differing degrees of capitula condensation. ITS and plastid trnL-trnF regions were analyzed separately and together using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood to examine the evolution of syncephalia in the Nassauviinae. The four genera displaying syncephalia do not form a clade minus taxa without syncephalia, indicating that secondary heads in Nassauviinae have either convergently evolved twice in the subtribe (or, very unlikely) once with multiple reversions. Strong support was obtained for a sister relationship between Leucheria (without syncephalium) and Polyachyrus, and both sister to Moscharia. Nassauvia and Triptilion form a distinct clade but are sister to other genera, Perezia and Panphalea, without syncephalium. Previous hypotheses postulated the evolution from simple to more complex secondary heads. We show that the ancestor of Moscharia, Polyachyrus, and Leucheria, in a more arid habitat, had a complex type of secondary head, and loss of complexity occurred in response to a shift from arid to mesic conditions.},

A molecular phylogeny including 40 of its 42 described taxa based on nucleotide sequences from two plastid regions (psbA-trnH and trnC-petN spacers) and one nuclear marker (nrDNA ITS) is presented. Phylogenetic reconstruction was hampered by inadequate phylogenetic signal indicating recent radiation of species during the last 5 Ma and high level of reticulate evolution presumably caused by hybridisation and polyploidisation. Nevertheless, Leptinella is nested within a paraphyletic genus Cotula that also engulfs the South American genus Soliva. Within Leptinella, the highly polyploid and sexually polymorphic subgenus Leptinella is monophyletic, while subgenus Oligoleima as well as subgenus Radiata are polyphyletic. We found a basal split between a lineage of Australian and New Guinean taxa and one of largely New Zealand taxa. At least five long-distance dispersal events have to be assumed in order to explain the distribution pattern in Leptinella. Among those, one is from New Zealand to Australia, while the others are dispersals to South America and to several subantarctic islands. The phylogeny presented here indicates that the ancestral sex expression in Leptinella is monoecy and that dioecy and paradioecy are derived conditions. High ploidy is especially common in the dioica-group, where dioecy is also common. However, the occurrence of a dioecious sex expression in tetraploid representatives of this group and of polyploidy in other clades that only exhibit monoecious or paradioecious conditions indicate that there is no consistent correlation between these two characters.},

	abstract = {The Centaurea group is part of the Circum-Mediterranean Clade (CMC) of genus Centaurea subgenus Centaurea, a mainly Mediterranean plant group with more than 200 described species. The group is traditionally split on morphological basis into three sections: Centaurea, Phalolepis and Willkommia. This division, however, is doubtful, especially in light of molecular approaches. In this study we try to resolve this phylogenetic problem and to consolidate the circumscription and delimitation of the entire group against other closely related groups. We analyzed nuclear (internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal genes) and chloroplast (rpl32-trnL intergenic spacer) DNA regions for most of the described species of the Centaurea group using phylogenetic and network approaches, and we checked the data for recombination. Phylogeny was used to reconstruct the evolution of the lacerate-membranaceous bract appendages using parsimony. The magnitude of incomplete lineage sorting was tested estimating the effective population sizes. Molecular dating was performed using a Bayesian approach, and the ancestral area reconstruction was conducted using the Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis method. Monophyly of the Centaurea group is confirmed if a few species are removed. Our results do not support the traditional sectional division. There is a high incongruence between the two markers and between genetic data and morphology. However, there is a clear relation between geography and the structure of the molecular data. Diversification in the Centaurea group mainly took place during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The ancestral area infered for the Circum-Mediterranean Clade of Centaurea is the Eastern Mediterranean, whereas for the Centaurea group it is most likely NW-Africa. The large incongruencies, which hamper phylogenetic reconstruction, are probably the result of introgression, even though the presence of incomplete lineage sorting as an additional factor cannot be ruled out. Convergent evolution of morphological traits may have led to incongruence between morphology-based, traditional systematics and molecular results. Our results also cast major doubts about current species delimitation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The precise generic delimitation of the Rhaponticum group is not totally resolved. The lack of knowledge of the relationships between the basal genera of Centaureinae could imply that genera whose position is as yet unresolved could belong to the Rhaponticum group. On the other hand, the affinities among the genera that are considered as members of this group are not well known. The aim of the study is to contribute to the phylogenetic and generic delineation of the Rhaponticum group on the basis of molecular data. METHODS Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of the combined sequences of one plastid (trnL-trnF) and two nuclear (ITS region and ETS) molecular markers were carried out. The results of these analyses are discussed in the light of the biogeographic history. KEY RESULTS The Rhaponticum group appears as monophyletic, and closely related to the genus Klasea. The results confirm the preliminary generic delimitation of the Rhaponticum group, with the new incorporation of the genus Centaurothamnus. Ochrocephala is supported as a separate genus from Rhaponticum and, contrary to this, Acroptilon and Leuzea appear as merged into the genus Rhaponticum. Several nomenclatural rearrangements are made in Klasea and Rhaponticum. CONCLUSIONS The new molecular evidence is consistent with the morphological and karyological data, and suggests particularly coherent biogeographic routes of migration and speciation processes for the genus Rhaponticum. The biogeographic inference proposes a Near East and/or Caucasian origin for the genus. Furthermore, representatives of Rhaponticum could have reached Europe in two different ways: (1) expansion across central Asia to eastern Europe, and (2) expansion through the Near East, North Africa and then to the Iberian Peninsula and the Alps.},

	abstract = {Subfamily Barnadesioideae (Asteraceae) consists of nine genera and 91 species endemic to South America. They include annual and perennial herbs, arching shrubs and trees up to 30m tall. Presumed sister to all other Asteraceae, its intergeneric relationships are key to understanding the early evolution of the family. Results of the only molecular study on the subfamily conflict with relationships inferred from morphology. We investigate inter- and intrageneric relationships in Barnadesioideae with novel DNA sequence data and morphological characters using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian inference. All results verify Barnadesioideae as monophyletic and sister to the rest of the family. A basal split within the subfamily is recognized, with Chuquiraga, Doniophyton and Duseniella in one clade, and Arnaldoa, Barnadesia, Dasyphyllum, Fulcaldea, Huarpea and possibly Schlechtendalia in another. The largest genus, Dasyphyllum, is revealed as biphyletic with the two clades separating along subgeneric and geographic lines. Schlechtendalia, suggested as the earliest diverging lineage of the subfamily by morphological studies and parsimony analyses, is found in a more derived position under model-based inference methods. Competing phylogenetic hypotheses, both previous and present, are evaluated using likelihood-based tests. Evolutionary trends within Barnadesioideae are inferred: hummingbird pollination has developed convergently at least three times. An early vicariance in the subfamily's distribution is revealed. X=9 is supported as the ancestral base chromosome number for both Barnadesioideae and the family as a whole.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The genus Centaurea has traditionally been considered to be a complicated taxon. No attempt at phylogenetic reconstruction has been made since recent revisions in circumscription, and previous reconstructions did not include a good representation of species. A new molecular survey is thus needed. METHODS Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2 and the 5.8S gene. Parsimony and Bayesian approaches were used. KEY RESULTS A close correlation between geography and the phylogenetic tree based on ITS sequences was found in all the analyses, with three main groups being resolved: (1) comprising the most widely distributed circum-Mediterranean/Eurosiberian sections; (2) the western Mediterranean sections; and (3) the eastern Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian sections. The results show that the sectional classification in current use needs major revision, with many old sections being merged into larger ones. A large polytomy in the eastern Mediterranean clade suggests a rapid and recent speciation in this group. Some inconsistencies between morphology and molecular phylogeny may indicate that hybridization has played a major role in the evolution of the genus. CONCLUSIONS Phylogenetic analysis of ITS has been useful in identifying the major lineages in the group, and unraveling many inconsistencies in the sectional classification. However, most recent groups in the eastern Mediterranean clade are not resolved and reticulation in the western Mediterranean group of sections makes phylogenetic relationships within these two groups somewhat obscure.},

	abstract = {Tribal delimitation of Cardueae is controversial, and the traditional classification in four subtribes (Echinopsidinae, Carlininae, Carduinae, and Centaureinae) has fluctuated widely. Most of the problems are centered in subtribes Echinopsidinae and Carlininae, often segregated with tribal rank. We therefore analyzed DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spaces (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA genes and the matK gene of the chloroplast DNA of a broad representation of the tribe to examine (1) the phylogeny of the tribe, (2) the position of Echinopsidinae and Carlininae, (3) the circumscription of the subtribes and the position of some conflicting genera, and (4) the delimitation of some generic complexes in the Carduinae. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS and matK sequence variation, both separate and combined, strongly support the monophyly of Cardueae including Carlininae and Echinopsidinae. The combination of both genomes suggest that Xeranthemum and its allies should be included among the Echinopsidinae rather than the Carlininae, which implies that the capitulum of Xeranthemum could be interpreted as a syncephaly. The subtribe Centaureinae forms a well-supported clade, and their sister clades contain the genera Arctium, Cousinia, Jurinea, and Saussurea from the Carduinae. However, some problems persist: Carduinae are a paraphyletic assemblage, and the subtribal placement of Berardia, Cardopatium, Cousiniopsis, and Staehelina remains unresolved. Our results also indicate that present classification in four subtribes is unsatisfactory, but it is still the only practical approach.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Artemisia subgenus Tridentatae plants characterize the North American Intermountain West. These are landscape-dominant constituents of important ecological communities and habitats for endemic wildlife. Together with allied species and genera (Picrothamnus and Sphaeromeria), they make up an intricate series of taxa whose limits are uncertain, likely the result of reticulate evolution. The objectives of this study were to resolve relations among Tridentatae species and their near relatives by delimiting the phylogenetic positions of subgenus Tridentatae species with particular reference to its New World geographic placement and to provide explanations for the relations of allied species and genera with the subgenus with an assessment of their current taxonomic placement. METHODS Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony analysis were based on 168 newly generated sequences (including the nuclear ITS and ETS and the plastid trnS(UGA)-trnfM(CAU) and trnS(GCU)-trnC(GCA)) and 338 previously published sequences (ITS and ETS). Genome size by flow cytometry of species from Sphaeromeria was also determined. KEY RESULTS The results support an expanded concept and reconfiguration of Tridentatae to accommodate additional endemic North American Artemisia species. The monotypic Picrothamnus and all Sphaeromeria species appear nested within subgenus Tridentatae clade. CONCLUSIONS A redefinition of subgenus Tridentatae to include other western North American endemics is supported. We propose a new circumscription of the subgenus and divide it into three sections: Tridentatae, Filifoliae, and Nebulosae. The position of the circumboreal and other North American species suggests that subgenus Artemisia is the ancestral stock for the New World endemics, including those native to South America.},

It is divided into two subtribes: Arctotidinae (ca. 5 genera, 85 species) and Gorteriinae (ca. 8 genera, 130 species). The monophyly of the genera within the subtribe Gorteriinae and their relationship to one another was investigated using 71 samples/212 sequences including 64/141 of which are newly reported from three phylogenetic markers, two from chloroplast DNA (trnL-F and ndhF) and one from the nuclear genome (ITS). The outgroup was composed of seven members from the sister subtribe. Results show the subtribe Gorteriinae to be divided into three monophyletic groups, the Gazania-Hirpicium-Gorteria group, the Didelta group, and the Berkheya-Cullumia group. Within these three groups are 13 sub-groups, one of which has sub-clades. The genus Berkheya Ehrh. is paraphyletic, falling into five different sub-groups. The two monotypic genera, Cuspidia and Heterorhachis are not nested within any of the Berkheya clades. Hirpicium and Cullumia each have most of their taxa in a monophyletic group, but they also have one or two taxa associated with other clades. Four of the five sub-groups of Berkheya have morphologically recognizable shared characters, such as habit and spines that have been recognized by past studies. However, the grouping of one species with Didelta is difficult to explain. Support for the major clades and most of the sub-groups is strong but the relationships among some of the terminal taxa are variable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Section Acrocentron of the genus Centaurea is one of the largest sections of Centaurea with approx. 100 species. The geographic distribution, centred in the Mediterranean, makes it an excellent example for studies of the biogeographic history of this biodiversity-rich region. METHODS Plastid (trnH-psbA) and nuclear (ITS and ETS) DNA sequence analysis was used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Ancestral biogeographic patterns were inferred by dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA). KEY RESULTS The resulting phylogeny has implications for the sectional classification of Acrocentron and confirms merging sect. Chamaecyanus into Acrocentron as a subsection. Previous suggestions of an eastern Mediterranean origin of the group are confirmed. The main centres of diversification established in previous studies are now strongly supported. Expansion of the group in two different radiations that followed patently diverse paths is inferred. CONCLUSIONS Radiation followed two waves, widely separated in time scale. The oldest one, from Turkey to Greece and the northern Balkans and then to North Africa and Iberia, should be dated at the end of the Miocene in the Messinian period. It reached the Iberian Peninsula from the south, following a route that is landmarked by several relictic taxa in Sicily and North Africa. A later radiation during the Holocene interglacial periods followed, involving species from the north of the Balkan Peninsula, along a Eurasian pathway running from Central Iberia to the steppes of Kazakhstan. A generalized pattern of reticulation is also evident from the results, indicating past contacts between presently separated species. Molecular data also confirmed the extent of hybridization within Acrocentron and were successful in reconstructing the paleogeography of the section.},

	abstract = {The study of recently formed species is important because it can help us to better understand organismal divergence and the speciation process. However, these species often present difficult challenges in the field of molecular phylogenetics because the processes that drive molecular divergence can lag behind phenotypic divergence. In the current study we show that species of the recently diverged North American endemic genus of purple coneflower, Echinacea, have low levels of molecular divergence. Data from three nuclear loci and two plastid loci provide neither resolved topologies nor congruent hypotheses about species-level relationships. This lack of phylogenetic resolution is likely due to the combined effects of incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization, and backcrossing following secondary contact. The poor resolution provided by molecular markers contrasts previous studies that found well-resolved and taxonomically supported relationships from metabolic and morphological data. These results suggest that phenotypic canalization, resulting in identifiable morphological species, has occurred rapidly within Echinacea. Conversely, molecular signals have been distorted by gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting. Here we explore the impact of natural history on the genetic organization and phylogenetic relationships of Echinacea.},

We argue that the morphological data set contains poor phylogenetic signal and advocate simultaneous analysis of the three data sets (total evidence approach) so that morphological characters are tested for homology by congruence with molecular data. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis allows several well-supported conclusions including the placement of a Corsican endemic (D. corsicum), sister to the remainder of the genus, and the inference that an early southern European or Mediterranean diversification took place in the genus. Shifts in morphological characters (e.g., homocarpy to heterocarpy) are confirmed to have evolved several times.

Chloroplast markers revealed the existence of two divergent haplotype groups within the subgenus that did not correspond to presumed relationships. Furthermore, chloroplast haplotypes of the genera Hispidella and Andryala nested each within one of these groups. In contrast, ITS data were generally in accord with morphology and other evidence and were therefore assumed to reflect the true phylogeny. They revealed a sister relationship between Pilosella and Hispidella and a joint clade of Hieracium subgenera Hieracium and Chionoracium (Stenotheca) while genus Andryala represented a third major lineage of the final ingroup cluster. Detailed analysis of trnT-trnL character state evolution along the ITS tree suggested two intergeneric hybridization events between ancestral lineages that resulted in cytoplasmic transfer (from Hieracium/Chionoracium to Pilosella, and from the introgressed Pilosella lineage to Andryala). These chloroplast capture events, the first of which involved a now extinct haplotype, are the most likely explanation for the observed incongruencies between plastid and nuclear DNA markers.},

The region between exons 17 and 23 was cloned and sequenced for 33 accessions of Arnica and four outgroup taxa. Three paralogues of the RPB2-d copy (RPB2-dA, B and C) were detected in Arnica and outgroup taxa, indicating that the duplications must have occurred before the divergence of Arnica. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of separate alignments of the three copies reveal complex patterns in Arnica, likely reflecting a history of lineage sorting in combination with apomixis, polyploidization, and possibly hybridization. Cloned sequences of some taxa do not form monophyletic clades within paralogues, but form multiple strongly supported clades with sequences of other taxa. Some well supported groups are present in more than one paralogue and many groups are in line with earlier hypotheses regarding interspecific relationships within the genus. Low levels of homoplasy in combination with relatively high sequence variation indicates that the introns of the RPB2 region could be suitable for phylogenetic studies in low level taxonomy.},

These plants are ecologically and culturally essential for both ecosystems and local inhabitants. The frailejones have been studied for over two centuries, but the taxonomic knowledge is still sparse and incomplete. The inedited monograph by Cuatrecasas contains only ca. 70\% of the species known today, and publications in the last decade disagree regarding the number of taxa within the group, with estimates ranging from 3 genera and 90 species to 8 genera and 154 species. Moreover the literature contains inexact information about their distribution. As part of a study of the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships of the group, a thorough revision of the nomenclature was needed as a first step. Currently the subtribe has 8 recognized genera, 141 species, 17 subspecies, 22 varieties, 8 forms, 33 recognized hybrids, 142 synonyms and 5 invalid names, for a total of 368 names (autonyms not counted).

Our results confirm the monophyly of Scorzoneroides and reveal the existence of two significant evolutionary lineages that do not coincide with major taxonomic subdivisions traditionally proposed for this genus. The first major group comprises taxa with all types of possible combinations of character states. The second major group includes exclusively homocarpic perennial taxa occurring in predictable habitats. It is strongly inferred that the most recent common ancestor of Scorzoneroides was perennial and homomorphic, and occurred in predictable habitats.

A total of 25-30 species has been recognized in five sections of Coreopsis in eastern North America. Based on morphological characters, these taxa have generally been considered a monophyletic group. Our well-resolved phylogeny supports the monophyly of sections that have been recognized in Coreopsis, but the sections collectively do not comprise a monophyletic group because species of north temperate Bidens occur within one of the two major Coreopsis clades. The most notable departure of present results from prior views of relationships among sections is the lack of a sister group relationship between sections Calliopsis and Eublepharis; the shared presence of four-lobed disk floret corollas had been used to support a close relationship between these two sections. Relationships within sections show both similarities and differences with the results of previous studies based primarily on morphological characters. Mapping of morphological characters used taxonomically in Coreopsis and related genera onto the phylogeny indicates that the evolution of these characters has been complex, and this compromises their value for defining monophyletic groups. Examples include the annual habit, alternate leaves, winged fruits, red or brown basal spots on the yellow ligules, and four-lobed disk floret corollas.},

	abstract = {To explore the biogeographic history of Mediterranean/arid plant disjunctions, Old and New World Senecio sect. Senecio were analyzed phylogenetically using nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (ITS). A clade corresponding to sect. Senecio was strongly supported. Area optimization indicated this clade to be of southern African origin. The Mediterranean and southern African floras were not distinguishable as sources of the main New World lineage, estimated to have become established during the middle Pliocene. Another previously suspected recent dispersal to the New World from the Mediterranean was confirmed for the recently recognized disjunction in S. mohavensis. The loss of suitable land connections by the Miocene means that both New World lineages must represent long-distance dispersal, providing the first evidence of repeat intercontinental dispersal in a Mediterranean group. In contrast, migration within Africa may have utilized an East African arid corridor. Recent dispersal to northern Africa is supported for S. flavus, which formed part of a distinct southern African lineage. Novel pappus modifications in both disjunct species may have enabled dispersal by birds. An estimated early Pliocene origin of sect. Senecio coincides with the appearance of summer-dry climate. However, diversification from 1.6 BP highlights the importance of Pleistocene climate fluctuations for speciation.},

	abstract = {Chromosome evolution (including polyploidy, dysploidy, and structural changes) as well as hybridization and introgression are recognized as important aspects in plant speciation. A suitable group for investigating the evolutionary role of chromosome number changes and reticulation is the medium-sized genus Melampodium (Millerieae, Asteraceae), which contains several chromosome base numbers (x=9, 10, 11, 12, 14) and a number of polyploid species, including putative allopolyploids. A molecular phylogenetic analysis employing both nuclear (ITS) and plastid (matK) DNA sequences, and including all species of the genus, suggests that chromosome base numbers are predictive of evolutionary lineages within Melampodium. Dysploidy, therefore, has clearly been important during evolution of the group. Reticulate evolution is evident with allopolyploids, which prevail over autopolyploids and several of which are confirmed here for the first time, and also (but less often) on the diploid level. Within sect. Melampodium, the complex pattern of bifurcating phylogenetic structure among diploid taxa overlain by reticulate relationships from allopolyploids has non-trivial implications for intrasectional classification.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Evolutionary significance of the Compositae capitulum and variation in its structure is poorly understood, although it may permit flexibility in sexual expression. Optimal sex ratio differs with life-history and reproductive strategy. We explore how the genus Ifloga and related members of southern African Gnaphalieae achieved different sex ratios, and the associations of these ratios with annual and perennial life history. METHODS Sex allocation was measured using the male to female ratio (M/F), a novel approximator of the pollen to ovule ratio (P/O). Life-history (annuality/perenniality), capitulum structure, capitular sexual system, and M/F were reconstructed on time-proportional phylogenies. Trait associations were examined using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). KEY RESULTS Annual taxa have strongly female-biased capitula, as measured by M/F, and either gynomonoecious or monoecious sexual systems, while perennials have equal or male-biased capitula that are hermaphroditic or monoecious. These results are largely supported by PIC analysis. Different sexual systems afford differing flexibility in sex allocation, with hermaphrodites having the least, and monoecious taxa the greatest, range in M/F. Within Ifloga, the anomalous capitulum evolved in an annual, gynomonoecious ancestor, followed by two independent gains of monoecy. Two subsequent gains of perenniality occurred within a monoecious sublineage. CONCLUSIONS Different life histories have divergent sex allocation optima and are strongly associated with different sexual systems in gnaphalioid daisies. An anomalous capitulum structure in Ifloga may have facilitated the evolution of monoecy, which in turn may be linked to the evolution of life-history diversity in the genus.},

We explore the age and evolutionary history of the tribe by means of a phylogenetic hypothesis based on Bayesian analysis of plastid and nuclear DNA sequences, maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral areas, and relaxed Bayesian dating. Early diversification occurred in southern Africa in the Eocene-Oligocene, resulting in a grade of mostly Cape-centred lineages which subsequently began speciating in the Miocene, consistent with diversification times for many Cape groups. Gnaphalieae from other geographic regions are embedded within a southern African paraphylum, indicating multiple dispersals out of southern Africa since the Oligocene to Miocene which established the tribe in the rest of the world. Colonisation of Australia via direct long-distance trans-oceanic dispersal in the Miocene resulted in the radiation which produced the Australasian gnaphalioid flora. The similarly diverse regional gnaphalioid floras of Australasia and southern Africa thus exhibit very different temporal species accumulation histories. An examination of the timing and direction of trans-Indian Ocean dispersal events in other angiosperms suggests a role for the West Wind Drift in long-distance dispersal eastwards from southern Africa.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED PREMISE OF THE STUDY Tribe Cardueae (thistles) forms one of the largest tribes in the family Compositae (2400 species), with representatives in almost every continent. The greatest species richness of Cardueae occurs in the Mediterranean region where it forms an important element of its flora. New fossil evidence and a nearly resolved phylogeny of Cardueae are used here to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of this group. • METHODS We performed maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA markers. Divergence times and ancestral area reconstructions for main lineages were estimated using penalized likelihood and dispersal-vicariance analyses, respectively, and integrated over the posterior distribution of the phylogeny from the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis to accommodate uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships. • KEY RESULTS The phylogeny shows that subtribe Cardopatiinae is sister to the remaining subtribes, and subtribes Carlininae and Echinopsinae appear as consecutive sister-clades to the Carduinae/Centaureinae. Tribe Cardueae is inferred to have originated around the Mid Eocene in West Asia, which is also the ancestral area of most subtribes within Cardueae. Diversification within each subtribe began during the Oligocene-Miocene period. • CONCLUSIONS Most diversification events within Cardueae are related to the continuous cycles of area connection and division between the Anatolian microplate and the western Mediterranean Basin during the Oligocene-Miocene and with the uplift of the Himalayan range from the Miocene onward. From these two regions, thistles dispersed and colonized the rest of the continents (e.g., the New World, Africa, and Australia), most likely during the colder Pliocene-Pleistocene period.},

Prior studies revealed little DNA sequence variation within the clade of ca. 10 Canary Island species of Tolpis, which precluded resolving species relationships. The present study assessed the utility of automated analysis of inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) loci for resolving relationships within the clade using 264 individuals from 36 populations of all recognized species and three undescribed morphological variants. Similarity (Dice coefficient) and Fitch parsimony were used to generate neighbor-joining (NJ) and strict consensus trees (MP), respectively. All individuals of the morphologically distinct endemic species formed clusters in both trees. There is also support for clusters of two undescribed variants in the NJ tree. Individuals from a morphologically variable complex consisting primarily of two species are not well resolved at population or species levels. The NJ and MP trees are not congruent at deeper levels, including relationships among species. Results are interpreted in terms of the biology of the species, and the utility of automated analysis of ISSR markers for interpreting patterns of evolution of Tolpis in the Canary Islands is discussed.},

	abstract = {Asteliaceae (4 genera, 36 species) are found on both continents and island archipelagos in the southern hemisphere and across the Pacific. The circumscription of Asteliaceae and intrageneric relationships are poorly understood. We generated a phylogeny including all genera and 99\% of the species using DNA sequence data from chloroplast (trnL, psbA-trnH, rps16, and petL-psbE) and nuclear (NIA-i3) regions. Relaxed clock methods were applied to infer the age of the family and the timing of cladogenic events. Generic delimitations change as a result of this study. Collospermum is nested within Astelia and is recognized here only at the subgeneric level. Further, Astelia subgenera Astelia, Asteliopsis, and Tricella are paraphyletic and to achieve monophyly their recircumscriptions are proposed. Despite the presence of Asteliaceae taxa on multiple Gondwanan landmasses and proposed Cretaceous origins for the family, radiation of genera was during the Tertiary. The largest and oldest genus, Astelia s.l. (including Collospermum), radiated around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (ca. 34.2 million years ago (Ma)). Astelia s.l. subgenera diverged from the Oligocene/Miocene boundary onwards ({\textless}24.0 Ma). These dates suggest that current distributions are most likely to be the result of long-distance dispersal. Alpine taxa in New Zealand and Australia radiated during the Late Miocene/Pliocene. These results are congruent with Astelia micro- and macro-fossil data and suggest that Astelia s.l. either persisted in New Zealand during the proposed Oligocene marine transgression or dispersed from Australia after the subsequent expansion of terrestrial habitat.},

Because organelle genomes like those of chloroplasts and mitochondria are thought to be non-recombining, with a single evolutionary history, we sequenced four additional chloroplast loci with the expectation that this would resolve these relationships. Instead, the conflict was only magnified. Although tree-building analyses favoured one of the three possible trees, one of the alternative trees actually had one more supporting site (six versus five) and received greater support in spectral and neighbor-net analyses. Simulations suggested that chance alone was unlikely to produce strong support for two of the possible trees and none for the third. Likelihood permutation tests indicated that the concatenated chloroplast sequence data appeared to have experienced recombination. However, recombination between the chloroplast genomes of different species would be highly atypical, and corollary supporting observations, like chloroplast heteroplasmy, are lacking. Wider taxon sampling clarified the composition of the Austral group, but the conflicting signal meant analyses (e.g., morphological evolution, biogeographic) conditional on a well-supported phylogeny could not be performed.},

We analyzed DNA sequences from three plastid regions (trnH-psbA, trnD-T, ndhF) and from the nuclear region phytochrome C (PHYC) with parsimony and maximum likelihood methods, and recovered a monophyletic Asparagus. The phylogeny conflicts with all previous infra-generic classifications. It has many strongly supported clades, corroborated by morphological characters, which may provide a basis for a revised taxonomy. Additionally, the phylogeny indicates that many of the current species delimitations are problematic. Using biogeographic analyses that account for phylogenetic uncertainty (S-DIVA) and take into account relative branch lengths (Lagrange) we confirm the origin of Asparagus in southern Africa, and find no evidence that the dispersal of Asparagus follow the Rand flora pattern. We find that all truly dioecious species of Asparagus share a common origin, but that sexual dimorphism has arisen independently several times.},

Their classification has been disputed due to different taxonomic interpretation and the difficulty in morphological characterization of the species and genera.

The combined dataset was analyzed using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analysis. Results show that 1) dracaenoids are monophyletic; 2) the Hawaiian Pleomele species are the sister group to the remainder of the dracaenoid clade; 3) species of Dracaena and the remaining Pleomele are intermixed; 4) Sansevieria is monophyletic, but nested within Dracaena; 5) the Central American species D. americana and D. cubensis are the sister group to the remainder of the non-Hawaiian dracaenoid species. The Hawaiian Pleomele are morphologically and phylogenetically distinct from the remaining dracaenoids and are recognized as a distinct genus, Chrysodracon, and new species combinations are made. Dracaena is paraphyletic in regards to Sansevieria and those species should be recognized as species of Dracaena. The polyphyletic status of Pleomele species nested within Dracaena confirms previous morphology based studies that combined these genera.},

	abstract = {The genus Asparagus comprises approximately 200 species, some of which are commercially cultivated, such as the garden asparagus (A. officinalis). Many Asparagus species, including A. officinalis, are dioecious and have been grouped into a subgenus distinct from that of hermaphroditic species. Although many interspecific crossings have been attempted to introduce useful traits into A. officinalis, only some of the dioecious species were found to be cross-compatible with A. officinalis. Here, molecular phylogenetic analyses were conducted to determine whether interspecific crossability is proportional to the genetic distance between the crossing pairs and to further clarify the evolutionary history of the Asparagus genus. A clade with all cross-compatible species and no cross-incompatible species was recovered in the phylogenetic tree based on analyses of non-coding cpDNA regions. In addition, a sex-linked marker developed for A. officinalis amplified a male-specific region in all cross-compatible species. The phylogenetic analyses also provided some insights about the evolutionary history of Asparagus; for example, by indicating that the genus had its origin in southern Africa, subsequently spreading throughout the old world through intensive speciation and dispersal. The results also suggest that dioecious species were derived from a single evolutionary transition from hermaphroditism in Asparagus. These findings not only contribute towards the understanding of the evolutionary history of the genus but may also facilitate future interspecific hybridization programs involving Asparagus species.},

Three genera (Behria, Jaimehintonia and Petronymphe) are monotypic while the remaining genera (Bessera, Dandya and Milla) contain from two to ten (Milla) species. Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses were conducted with plastid and nuclear DNA sequences from a total of 181 plants belonging to 15 species in all six genera. Molecular dating was performed under a relaxed clock model. We examined the phylogenetic relationships of the genera and species, estimated origin-divergence times for the clade and genera and determined the ancestral distribution area of the clade by optimizing ancestral areas given current biogeographic distributions. The phylogenetic results suggest that final decisions on limits of the six genera in the Milla clade will have to be established until further taxonomic work is completed for Milla, in particular for the group of populations included under the name M. biflora. The later genus is rendered polyphyletic by other genera of the family. The origin of the Milla clade is estimated at 15.8Ma. Ancestral area of the clade most likely was located in the California Floristic Province and dispersal occurred most likely to the Chihuahuan-Coahuila Plateaus and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and from there to Baja California and the Sierra Madre del Sur. Two hypotheses that need further testing are proposed to explain complex relationships of genera and polyphyly of Milla, one in relation to fragmentation of populations and pollinator shifts and another suggesting that populations remained in refugia in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.},

	abstract = {The drivers of angiosperm diversity have long been sought and the flower-arthropod association has often been invoked as the most powerful driver of the angiosperm radiation. We now know that features that influence arthropod interactions cannot only affect the diversification of lineages, but also expedite or constrain their rate of extinction, which can equally influence the observed asymmetric richness of extant angiosperm lineages. The genus Asarum (Aristolochiaceae; ∼100 species) is widely distributed in north temperate forests, with substantial vegetative and floral divergence between its three major clades, Euasarum, Geotaenium, and Heterotropa. We used Binary-State Speciation and Extinction Model (BiSSE) Net Diversification tests of character state distributions on a Maximum Likelihood phylogram and a Coalescent Bayesian species tree, inferred from seven chloroplast markers and nuclear rDNA, to test for signal of asymmetric diversification, character state transition, and extinction rates of floral and vegetative characters. We found that reduction in vegetative growth, loss of autonomous self-pollination, and the presence of putative fungal-mimicking floral structures are significantly correlated with increased diversification in Asarum. No significant difference in model likelihood was identified between symmetric and asymmetric rates of character state transitions or extinction. We conclude that the flowers of the Heterotropa clade may have converged on some aspects of basidiomycete sporocarp morphology and that brood-site mimicry, coupled with a reduction in vegetative growth and the loss of autonomous self-pollination, may have driven diversification within Asarum.},

Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses used either plastid or nuclear loci alone and varied greatly in their taxonomic implications for the genus. We analyzed additional molecular markers from the nuclear and plastid genomes, reevaluated the possibility of a derived loss of autonomous self-pollination, and investigated the topological effects of matrix-partitioning-scheme choice. METHODS We sequenced seven plastid regions and the nuclear ITS1-ITS2 region of 58 individuals representing all previously recognized Asarum s.l. segregate genera and the monotypic genus Saruma. Matrices were partitioned using common a priori partitioning schemes and PartitionFinder. KEY RESULTS Topologies that were recovered using a priori partitioning of matrices differed from those recovered using a PartitionFinder-selected scheme, and by analysis method. We recovered six monophyletic groups that we circumscribed into three subgenera and six sections. Putative fungal mimic characters served as synapomorphies only for subgenus Heterotropa. Subgenus Geotaenium, a new subgenus, was recovered as sister to the remainder of Asarum by ML analyses of highly partitioned datasets. Section Longistylis, also newly named, is sister to section Hexastylis. CONCLUSIONS Our analyses do not unambiguously support a single origin for all fungal-mimicry characters. Topologies recovered through the analysis of PartitionFinder-optimized matrices can differ drastically from those inferred from a priori partitioned matrices, and by analytical method. We recommend that investigators evaluate the topological effects of matrix partitioning using multiple methods of phylogenetic reconstruction.},

While many of these taxa are familiar, cultivated ornamental palms in warm areas of the world, the monophyly of the subtribe and its component genera required testing. We also examined the biogeographic relationships of this lineage, which has a significant radiation east of Wallace's Line. METHODS Phylogenetic analyses were based on maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of nucleotide sequences of two low-copy nuclear genes: intron 4 of phosphoribulokinase and intron 23 of RNA polymerase II. Biogeographical reconstructions were explored using S-DIVA. KEY RESULTS The two-gene, combined analysis yielded a monophyletic subtribe with six major clades. The biogeographical analysis suggests that the subtribe originated in New Guinea. CONCLUSIONS The phylogenetic hypotheses support the monophyly of the subtribe. The genera Drymophloeus, Ponapea, and Veitchia, as presently circumscribed, are not monophyletic. The resurrection and expanded circumscription of the genus Ponapea are supported. A newly discovered species of Adonidia is confirmed as sister species to Adonidia merrillii. Our phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that the Ptychospermatinae diverged into six major clades with repeated radiations into Australia and the western Pacific. The presence of Adonidia to the west of Wallace's Line is likely to be the result of long-distance dispersal. The following new combinations are made to restore monophyly to Veitchia and Ponapea: Veitchia pachyclada, V. subisticha, V. lepidota, and Ponapea hentyi.},

It includes a Caribbean lineage (tribe Cyclospathae), a southern hemisphere disjunction (tribe Ceroxyleae), and an amphi-Andean element (tribe Phytelepheae), until recently considered a distinct subfamily (Phytelephantoideae) due to its highly derived morphology. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to account for the biogeography of the subfamily, involving Gondwanan vicariance, austral interplate dispersal from South America to Australia via Antarctica, Andean orogeny, and Pleistocene refuges. We assessed the systematic classification and biogeography of the group based on a densely sampled phylogeny using {\textgreater}5.5kb of DNA sequences from three plastid and two nuclear genomic regions. The subfamily and each of its three tribes were resolved as monophyletic with high support. Divergence time estimates based on penalized likelihood and Bayesian dating methods indicate that Gondwanan vicariance is highly unlikely as an explanation for basic disjunctions in tribe Ceroxyleae. Alternative explanations include a mid-Tertiary trans-Atlantic/trans-African dispersal track and the "lemurian stepping stones" hypothesis. Austral interplate dispersal of Oraniopsis to Australia could have occurred, but apparently only in the mid-Eocene/early Oligocene interval after global cooling had begun. Our data do not support Pleistocene climatic changes as drivers for speciation in the Andean-centered Phytelepheae as previously proposed. Radiation in this tribe coincides largely with the major uplift of the Andes, favoring Andean orogeny over Pleistocene climatic changes as a possible speciation-promoting factor in this tribe.},

The prevailing current taxonomy of Chamaedorea recognizes approximately 100 species in eight subgenera, all delimited using floral characters, which provide a useful starting point to explore species-level systematics. Sequence data from 63 species, including representatives of all eight subgenera, were analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference optimality criteria. Genus Chamaedorea is resolved as monophyletic with strong support in all separate and combined analyses. The less species-rich subgenera are convincingly monophyletic and can be diagnosed using morphological synapomorphies. In contrast, the two largest subgenera, Chamaedorea and Chamaedoropsis, which are supposedly distinguishable from each other by the degree of connation in the staminate petals, are both resolved as highly polyphyletic. Several well supported monophyletic groups resolved by these gene regions have never before been proposed within Chamaedorea and are challenging to delimit using morphological criteria. Although PRK proved more informative than RPB2, both regions have strong utility for interpreting species-level relationships among the palms, which are notoriously recalcitrant subjects for molecular phylogenetic studies. In addition, a paralog of the target copy of PRK identified during the analysis represents a potentially valuable source of phylogenetic information for future studies.},

In the first exhaustive sampling of all 65 genera of the Areceae, we examined relationships of two of the tribe's most problematic genera, Heterospathe and Rhopaloblaste, using portions of the low-copy nuclear genes phosphoribulokinase (PRK) and RNA-polymerase II subunit B (RPB2). Both genera fell within a highly supported clade comprising all Areceae genera, but are clearly unrelated. Rhopaloblaste was strongly supported as monophyletic and is most closely related to Indian Ocean genera. Heterospathe was resolved with strong support within a clade of western Pacific genera, but with the monotypic Alsmithia nested within it. Ptychosperma micranthum, which has previously been included in both Heterospathe and Rhopaloblaste, is excluded from these and from Ptychosperma, supporting its recent placement in a new genus Dransfieldia. Morphological comparisons indicate that the crownshaft is putatively synapomorphic for the Areceae with numerous reversals within the clade and some independent origins elsewhere. The putative diagnostic characters of Heterospathe show high levels of homoplasy, and the genus can only be distinguished by a suite of characters, whereas Rhopaloblaste is more clearly defined.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Molecular phylogenetic studies of palms (Arecaceae) have not yet provided a fully resolved phylogeny of the family. There is a need to increase the current set of markers to resolve difficult groups such as the Neotropical subtribe Bactridinae (Arecoideae: Cocoseae). We propose the use of two single-copy nuclear genes as valuable tools for palm phylogenetics. METHODS New primers were developed for the amplification of the AGAMOUS 1 (AG1) and PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB) genes. For the AGAMOUS gene, the paralogue 1 of Elaeis guineensis (EgAG1) was targeted. The region amplified contained coding sequences between the MIKC K and C MADS-box domains. For the PHYB gene, exon 1 (partial sequence) was first amplified in palm species using published degenerate primers for Poaceae, and then specific palm primers were designed. The two gene portions were sequenced in 22 species of palms representing all genera of Bactridinae, with emphasis on Astrocaryum and Hexopetion, the status of the latter genus still being debated. KEY RESULTS The new primers designed allow consistent amplification and high-quality sequencing within the palm family. The two loci studied produced more variability than chloroplast loci and equally or less variability than PRK, RPBII and ITS nuclear markers. The phylogenetic structure obtained with AG1 and PHYB genes provides new insights into intergeneric relationships within the Bactridinae and the intrageneric structure of Astrocaryum. The Hexopetion clade was recovered as monophyletic with both markers and was weakly supported as sister to Astrocaryum sensu stricto in the combined analysis. The rare Astrocaryum minus formed a species complex with Astrocaryum gynacanthum. Moreover, both AG1 and PHYB contain a microsatellite that could have further uses in species delimitation and population genetics. CONCLUSIONS AG1 and PHYB provide additional phylogenetic information within the palm family, and should prove useful in combination with other genes to improve the resolution of palm phylogenies.},

The data were used to evaluate monophyly of the subtribe and its component genera, explore the radiation of the group across its range, and examine evolution of protandry and protogyny, which is particularly diverse in Arecinae. The subtribe and some genera are not monophyletic. Three lineages of Arecinae are recovered: one widespread, but centered on the Sunda Shelf, another endemic to the islands east of Wallace's line and a third, comprising the Sri Lanka endemic Loxococcus, that is most closely related to genera from outside subtribe Arecinae. Strong support is obtained for broadening the circumscription of the genus Hydriastele to include Gronophyllum, Gulubia and Siphokentia. In clarifying phylogenetic relationships, we have demonstrated that a perceived bimodal distribution of the subtribe across Wallace's line does not in fact exist. Character optimizations indicate that the evolution of protogyny, an unusual condition in palms, is potentially correlated with a large radiation in the genus Pinanga and possibly also to dramatic diversification in pollen morphology and genome size. The evolution of dichogamy in the clade endemic to the east of Wallace's line is complex and reveals a pattern of numerous transformations between protandry and protogyny that is in marked contrast with other Arecinae. We suggest that this contrast is most likely a reflection of differing geological histories and pollinator spectra in each region.},

	abstract = {The unique properties of tree building in Arecaceae strongly constrain their architectural lability. Potentially compensating for this limitation, the extensive diversification of leaf anatomical structure within palms involves many characters whose alternate states may confer disparate mechanical or physiological capabilities. In the context of a recent global palm phylogeny, we analyzed the evolution of 10 such lamina anatomical characters and leaf morphology of 161 genera, conducting parsimony and maximum likelihood ancestral state reconstructions, as well as tests of correlated evolution. Lamina morphology evolves independently from anatomy. Although many characters do optimize as synapomorphic for major clades, anatomical evolution is highly homoplasious. Nevertheless, it is not random: analyses indicate the recurrent evolution of different cohorts of correlated character states. Notable are two surface layer (epidermis and hypodermis) types: (1) a parallel-laminated type of rectangular epidermal cells with sinuous anticlinal walls, with fibers present in the hypodermis and (2) a cross-laminated type of hexagonal cells in both layers. Correlated with the cross-laminated type is a remarkable decrease in the volume fraction of fibers, accompanied by changes in the architecture and sheath cell type of the transverse veins. We discuss these and other major patterns of anatomical evolution in relation to their biomechanical and ecophysiological significance.},

Three species have large stems and are rare, patchily distributed, and seldom collected. The other three species have small stems, are common and frequently collected, but also patchily distributed. One species of small plants, R. gracilis, exhibits considerable variability. Within this species, seven distinct groups can be recognized, although sample size is limited. Among species, there is a phyletic decrease in size of plants, from the basal species with large stems to derived species with small stems. For leaves and inflorescences there is also an associated decrease in size, but one species does not follow this trend. In this species, R. latisecta, there is evidence of a large ontogenetic change in leaf development. Phyletic decrease in size corresponds to a latitudinal and elevational gradient suggesting speciation has taken place from north to south and from high to low elevation. However, this pattern is obscured disjunct distributions in some species.},

No such phylogeny has, however, been generated for any major plant group yet, but here we generate such a phylogeny for the palm family (Arecaceae). We do this using a novel Bayesian approach, estimating the validity of intra-generic taxonomic groupings as topological constraints to assist in placing species without genetic or morphological data. From these we implement those that are supported by genetic or morphological data for a given genus or for related genera. The intergeneric relationships in our new phylogeny are surprisingly different from earlier phylogenies in the placement of genera within tribes, but largely identical to previous findings in the deeper branches in the phylogeny, pointing to the need for incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty in analyses based on this phylogeny. Initial analyses of the new phylogeny suggest non-constancy in diversification rates over time within genera, with an apparent increase in diversification rate over time, but no evidence for any geographic variation in the magnitude of this increase. We hope that our study will stimulate further evolutionary or ecological studies using palms as study organisms as well as discussions of the optimal way to place the many species without genetic or morphological data.},

Competing hypotheses contend that Livistona is (a) ancient, its current distribution a relict of the supercontinents, or (b) a Miocene immigrant from the north into Australia as it drifted towards Asia. We have tested these hypotheses using Bayesian and penalized likelihood molecular dating based on 4Kb of nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences with multiple fossil calibration points. Ancestral areas and biomes were reconstructed using parsimony and maximum likelihood. We found strong support for the second hypothesis, that a single Livistona ancestor colonized Australia from the north about 10-17Ma. Spread and diversification of the genus within Australia was likely favoured by a transition from the aseasonal wet to monsoonal biome, to which it could have been preadapted by fire-tolerance.},

Resolution of the palm phylogeny has been problematic due to rapid diversification and slow rates of molecular evolution. The focus of this study is on relationships of the 14 tribes of subfamily Arecoideae and their inferred ancestral areas. A targeted sequencing approach was used to generate a data set of 168 single/low copy nuclear genes for 34 species representing the Arecoideae tribes and the other palm subfamilies. Species trees from the concatenated and coalescent based analyses recovered largely congruent topologies. Three major tribal clades were recovered: the POS clade (Podococceae, Oranieae, Sclerospermeae), the RRC clade (Roystoneeae, Reinhardtieae, Cocoseae), and the core arecoid clade (Areceae, Euterpeae, Geonomateae, Leopoldinieae, Manicarieae, Pelagodoxeae). Leopoldinieae was sister to the rest of the core arecoids (Geonomateae, Manicarieae+Pelagodoxeae, and Areceae+Euterpeae). The nuclear phylogeny supported a North American origin for subfamily Arecoideae, with most tribal progenitors diversifying within the Americas. The POS clade may have dispersed from the Americas into Africa, with tribe Oranieae subsequently spreading into the Indo-Pacific. Two independent dispersals into the Indo-Pacific were inferred for two tribes within the core arecoids (tribes Areceae and Pelagodoxeae).},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Several studies have incorporated molecular and morphological data to study the phylogeny of the palms (Arecaceae), but some relationships within the family remain ambiguous-particularly those within Arecoideae, the most diverse subfamily including coconut and oil palm. Here, two next-generation, targeted plastid-enrichment methods were compared and used to elucidate Arecoideae phylogeny. METHODS Next-generation sequencing techniques were used to generate a plastid genome data set. Long range PCR and hybrid gene capture were used to enrich for chloroplast targets. Ten taxa were enriched using both methods for comparison. Chloroplast sequence data were generated for 31 representatives of the 14 Arecoideae tribes and five outgroup taxa. The phylogeny was reconstructed using maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian analyses. KEY RESULTS Long range PCR and hybrid gene capture both enriched the plastid genome and provided similar sequencing coverage. Subfamily Arecoideae was resolved as monophyletic with tribe Chamaedoreeae as the earliest-diverging lineage, implying that the development of flowers in triads defines a synapomorphy for the Arecoideae clade excluding Chamaedoreeae. Three major clades within this group were recovered: Roystoneeae/Reinhardtieae/Cocoseae (RRC), Areceae/Euterpeae/Geonomateae/Leopoldinieae/Manicarieae/Pelagodoxeae (core arecoids), and Podococceae/Oranieae/Sclerospermeae (POS). An Areceae + Euterpeae clade was resolved within the core arecoids. The POS clade was sister to a RRC + core arecoids clade, implying a shared ancestral area in South America for these three clades. CONCLUSIONS The plastome phylogeny recovered here provides robust resolution of previously ambiguous studies and new insights into palm evolution.},

	abstract = {Supertree and supermatrix methods have great potential in the quest to build the tree of life and yet they remain controversial, with most workers opting for one approach or the other, but rarely both. Here, we employed both methods to construct phylogenetic trees of all genera of palms (Arecaceae/Palmae), an iconic angiosperm family of great economic importance. We assembled a supermatrix consisting of 16 partitions, comprising DNA sequence data, plastid restriction fragment length polymorphism data, and morphological data for all genera, from which a highly resolved and well-supported phylogenetic tree was built despite abundant missing data. To construct supertrees, we used variants of matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) analysis based on input trees generated directly from subsamples of the supermatrix. All supertrees were highly resolved. Standard MRP with bootstrap-weighted matrix elements performed most effectively in this case, generating trees with the greatest congruence with the supermatrix tree and fewest clades unsupported by any input tree. Nonindependence due to input trees based on combinations of data partitions was an acceptable trade-off for improvements in supertree performance. Irreversible MRP and the use of strictly independent input trees only provided no obvious benefits. Contrary to previous claims, we found that unsupported clades are not infrequent under some MRP implementations, with up to 13\% of clades lacking support from any input tree in some irreversible MRP supertrees. To build a formal synthesis, we assessed the cross-corroboration between supermatrix trees and the variant supertrees using semistrict consensus, enumerating shared clades and compatible clades. The semistrict consensus of the supermatrix tree and the most congruent supertree contained 160 clades (of a maximum of 204), 137 of which were present in both trees. The relationships recovered by these trees strongly support the current phylogenetic classification of palms. We evaluate 2 composite supertree support measures (rQS and V) and conclude that it is more informative to report numbers of input trees that support or conflict with a given supertree clade. This study demonstrates that supertree and supermatrix methods can provide effective, explicit, and complimentary mechanisms for synthesizing disjointed phylogenetic evidence while emphasizing the need for further refinement of supertree methods.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The Arecoideae is the largest and most diverse of the five subfamilies of palms (Arecaceae/Palmae), containing {\textgreater}50 \% of the species in the family. Despite its importance, phylogenetic relationships among Arecoideae are poorly understood. Here the most densely sampled phylogenetic analysis of Arecoideae available to date is presented. The results are used to test the current classification of the subfamily and to identify priority areas for future research. METHODS DNA sequence data for the low-copy nuclear genes PRK and RPB2 were collected from 190 palm species, covering 103 (96 \%) genera of Arecoideae. The data were analysed using the parsimony ratchet, maximum likelihood, and both likelihood and parsimony bootstrapping. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Despite the recovery of paralogues and pseudogenes in a small number of taxa, PRK and RPB2 were both highly informative, producing well-resolved phylogenetic trees with many nodes well supported by bootstrap analyses. Simultaneous analyses of the combined data sets provided additional resolution and support. Two areas of incongruence between PRK and RPB2 were strongly supported by the bootstrap relating to the placement of tribes Chamaedoreeae, Iriarteeae and Reinhardtieae; the causes of this incongruence remain uncertain. The current classification within Arecoideae was strongly supported by the present data. Of the 14 tribes and 14 sub-tribes in the classification, only five sub-tribes from tribe Areceae (Basseliniinae, Linospadicinae, Oncospermatinae, Rhopalostylidinae and Verschaffeltiinae) failed to receive support. Three major higher level clades were strongly supported: (1) the RRC clade (Roystoneeae, Reinhardtieae and Cocoseae), (2) the POS clade (Podococceae, Oranieae and Sclerospermeae) and (3) the core arecoid clade (Areceae, Euterpeae, Geonomateae, Leopoldinieae, Manicarieae and Pelagodoxeae). However, new data sources are required to elucidate ambiguities that remain in phylogenetic relationships among and within the major groups of Arecoideae, as well as within the Areceae, the largest tribe in the palm family.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Robust species delimitations are fundamental for conservation, evolutionary, and systematic studies, but they can be difficult to estimate, particularly in rapid and recent radiations. The consensus that species concepts aim to identify evolutionarily distinct lineages is clear, but the criteria used to distinguish evolutionary lineages differ based on the perceived importance of the various characteristics of evolving populations. We examined three different species-delimitation criteria (monophyly, absence of genetic intermediates, and diagnosability) to determine whether currently recognized species of Hawaiian Pritchardia are distinct lineages. RESULTS Data from plastid and nuclear genes, microsatellite loci, and morphological characters resulted in various levels of lineage subdivision that were likely caused by differing evolutionary rates between data sources. Additionally, taxonomic entities may be confounded because of the effects of incomplete lineage sorting and/or gene flow. A coalescent species tree was largely congruent with the simultaneous analysis, consistent with the idea that incomplete lineage sorting did not mislead our results. Furthermore, gene flow among populations of sympatric lineages likely explains the admixture and lack of resolution between those groups. CONCLUSIONS Delimiting Hawaiian Pritchardia species remains difficult but the ability to understand the influence of the evolutionary processes of incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization allow for mechanisms driving species diversity to be inferred. These processes likely extend to speciation in other Hawaiian angiosperm groups and the biota in general and must be explicitly accounted for in species delimitation.},

	abstract = {The study of three island groups of the palm tribe Trachycarpeae (Arecaceae/Palmae) permits both the analysis of each independent radiation and comparisons across the tribe to address general processes that drive island diversification. Phylogenetic relationships of Trachycarpeae were inferred from three plastid and three low-copy nuclear genes. The incongruent topological position of Brahea in CISP5 was hypothesized to be caused by a gene duplication event and was addressed using uninode coding. The resulting phylogenetic trees were well-resolved and the genera were all highly supported except for Johannesteijsmannia and Serenoa. Divergence time analysis estimated the stem of the tribe to be approximately 86 Ma and the crown to be 38 Ma, indicating that significant extinction may have occurred along this branch. Historical biogeographic analysis suggested that Trachycarpeae are of southern North American, Central American, or Caribbean origin and supports previous hypotheses of a Laurasian origin. The biogeography and disjunctions within the tribe were interpreted with respect to divergence times, the fossil record, and geological factors such as the formation of the Greater Antilles--Aves Ridge, the Bering and the North Atlantic land bridges, tectonic movement in Southeast Asia, climatic shifts between the Eocene and Pliocene, and volcanism in the Pacific basin. In considering the three major island radiations within Trachycarpeae, Miocene dispersal appears to have been the driving force in allopatric speciation and is highlighted here as an emerging pattern across the tree of life.},

	abstract = {The palm subtribe Ptychospermatinae (Arecaceae: Arecoideae) is naturally distributed in the South West Pacific area and contains 12 genera and around 60 species, including numerous popular ornamentals. Like many palms, Ptychospermatinae flowers are small, trimerous, unisexual and always grouped into inflorescences of various sizes. However they exhibit a wide diversity in stamen number (a few to several dozen or even hundreds) that is poorly understood from an evolutionary point of view. Although advances have been made in elucidating phylogenetic relationships within Ptychospermatinae, some relationships among and within genera still remain to be clarified. Here we used a combination of five nuclear markers (nrITS2, the conserved nuclear intron BRSC10 and three low copy genes, PRK, RPB2 and AGAMOUS) and three chloroplast markers (matK, ndhA and rps15-ycf1) to propose a new phylogenetic hypothesis for the subtribe. The combination of all these markers improved the resolution and robustness of phylogenetic relationships within the subtribe, allowing us to identify four major clades. This phylogenetic framework was used to examine the evolution of stamen number in the clade. The optimization of stamen number on the phylogeny highlighted the high level of interspecific variability, showing that the character is highly labile and raising questions about the evolutionary and functional significance of this lability.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Despite its small size, New Caledonia is characterized by a very diverse flora and striking environmental gradients, which make it an ideal setting to study species diversification. Thirteen of the 19 Araucaria species are endemic to the territory and form a monophyletic group, but patterns and processes that lead to such a high species richness are largely unexplored. METHODS We used 142 polymorphic AFLP markers and performed analyses based on Bayesian clustering algorithms, genetic distances, and cladistics on 71 samples representing all New Caledonian Araucaria species. We examined correlations between the inferred evolutionary relationships and shared morphological, ecological, or geographic parameters among species, to investigate evolutionary processes that may have driven speciation. KEY RESULTS We showed that genetic divergence among the present New Caledonian Araucaria species is low, suggesting recent diversification rather than pre-existence on Gondwana. We identified three genetic groups that included small-leaved, large-leaved, and coastal species, but detected no association with soil preference, ecological habitat, or rainfall. The observed patterns suggested that speciation events resulted from both differential adaptation and vicariance. Last, we hypothesize that speciation is ongoing and/or there are cryptic species in some genetically (sometimes also morphologically) divergent populations. CONCLUSIONS Further data are required to provide better resolution and understanding of the diversification of New Caledonian Araucaria species. Nevertheless, our study allowed insights into their evolutionary relationships and provides a framework for future investigations on the evolution of this emblematic group of plants in one of the world's biodiversity hotspots.},

Their phylogenetic relationships remain largely unresolved. Using nuclear microsatellites and chloroplast DNA sequencing, we focused on five closely related Araucaria species to investigate among-species relationships and the distribution of within-species genetic diversity across New Caledonia. RESULTS The species could be clearly distinguished here, except A. montana and A. laubenfelsii that were not differentiated and, at most, form a genetic cline. Given their apparent morphological and ecological similarity, we suggested that these two species may be considered as a single evolutionary unit. We observed cases of nuclear admixture and incongruence between nuclear and chloroplast data, probably explained by introgression and shared ancestral polymorphism. Ancient hybridization was evidenced between A. biramulata and A. laubenfelsii in Mt Do, and is strongly suspected between A. biramulata and A. rulei in Mt Tonta. In both cases, extensive asymmetrical backcrossing eliminated the influence of one parent in the nuclear DNA composition. Shared ancestral polymorphism was also observed for cpDNA, suggesting that species diverged recently, have large effective sizes and/or that cpDNA experienced slow rates of molecular evolution. Within-species genetic structure was pronounced, probably because of low gene flow and significant inbreeding, and appeared clearly influenced by geography. This may be due to survival in distinct refugia during Quaternary climatic oscillations. CONCLUSIONS The study species probably diverged recently and/or are characterized by a slow rate of cpDNA sequence evolution, and introgression is strongly suspected. Within-species genetic structure is tightly linked with geography. We underline the conservation implications of our results, and highlight several perspectives.},

	abstract = {The intercontinental biogeography between eastern Asia and eastern North America has attracted much attention from evolutionary biologists. Further insights into understanding the evolution of the intercontinental disjunctions have been hampered by the lack of studies on the intracontinental biogeography in eastern Asia, a region with complex geology, geography, climates and habitats. Herein we studied the biogeographic history of the eastern Asian-eastern North American disjunct genus Panax with special emphasis on the investigation of its uneven diversification in Asia. This study reconstructs the diversification history of Panax and also emphasizes a large clade of Panax taxa, which has a wide distribution in eastern Asia, but was unresolved in previous studies. We examined the noncoding plastid DNA fragments of trnH-psbA, rps16, and psbM-trnD, the mitochondrial b/c intron of NAD1, and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of 356 samples from 47 populations. The results revealed the subtropical Northern Hemisphere origin (Asia or Asia and North America) of Panax in the Paleocene. Intercontinental disjunctions between eastern Asia and eastern North America formed twice in Panax, once estimated in early Eocene for the split of P. trifolius and another in mid-Miocene for the divergence of P. quinquefolius. Intercontinental diversifications in Panax showed temporal correlation with the increase of global temperature. The evolutionary radiation of the P. bipinnatifidus species complex occurred around the boundary of Oligocene and Miocene. Strong genetic structure among populations of the species complex was detected and the populations may be isolated by distance. The backbone network and the Bayesian clustering analysis revealed a major evolutionary radiation centered in the Hengduan Mountains of western China. Our results suggested that the evolutionary radiation of Panax was promoted by geographic barriers, including mountain ranges (Hengduan Mountains, Nanling Mountains and Wuyishan Mountains), oceans and altitudinal shifts, which further contribute to the knowledge of the uneven species diversification between eastern Asia and North America.},

When plant species are the result of recent divergence and gene flow and/or hybridization occur, the use of continuous morphological characters may help in species identification and delimitation. Between nine and 15 species have been recognized in the last treatments of Hedera. The recent divergence of the species and the involvement of allopolyploidization as the main force in this process may have greatly impeded the establishment of clear limits and contributed to multiple taxonomic proposals. • METHODS A multivariate statistical decision-making procedure was applied to 56 quantitative morphological characters and 602 specimens to identify and delimit Hedera species under the general lineage concept. Species' exclusive genetic ancestry was evaluated with the genealogical sorting index from the Bayesian inference trees of 30 Hedera ITS sequences. • KEY RESULTS The decision-making procedure allowed recognizing 12 species and two groups (stellate and scale-like trichome groups) in Hedera and provided statistical support for making decisions about long-standing taxonomic controversies. Common ancestry was detected for the populations of three species even in the absence of the species monophyly. • CONCLUSIONS Quantitative variation supports discrete variation and provides statistical support for the taxa recognized in some recent proposals of Hedera. The need of explicit analysis of quantitative data are claimed to reduce taxonomic subjectivity and ease decision-making when qualitative data fail.},

The Mediterranean diversity centre and temperate affinity of ivies contrast with the inferred Asian centre of diversity of the primarily tropical and subtropical Asian Palmate group. We herein investigated the sister-group relationships of Hedera to reconstruct the evolutionary context for its origin and early diversification. Seven nuclear and plastid DNA regions were analyzed in 61 Araliaceae samples including all the 18 Asian Palmate genera. Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference were run together with a battery of topology testing analyses constraining the expected Hedera's sister-group relationships. Additionally, Bayesian polytomy resolvability and divergence time analyses were also conducted. Genome incongruence and hard nuclear and plastid basal polytomies are detected for the Asian Palmate group where the lineage of Hedera is placed. Topology testing analyses do not allow rejecting any of the tentative sisters of Hedera. An early radiation with inter-lineage hybridization and genome doubling is suggested for the Asian Palmate group where all the seven temperate genera, including Hedera, seem to have played an important role. The radiation took placed during the Upper Cretaceous in Asia under a general cooling and the eastern Asian mountain uplift that produced new temperate environments and promoted lineage connections. This allows us to hypothesize that the origin of the Hedera lineage may fit in a temperate niche conservatism scenario where the combination of the radiation with lineage admixtures prevents us from discovering its sister-group.},

	abstract = {Pseudopanax (Araliaceae) comprises 12 tree species of diverse morphology and ecology, and is endemic to New Zealand. It is notable for the hybridisation that occurs between P. crassifolius and P. lessonii, which have very different leaves and habits. To provide context for the study of this hybridisation and other investigations, we examined the phylogeny of Pseudopanax using chloroplast DNA sequences (c.5900 base-pairs) and AFLP DNA-fingerprinting. Both approaches resolve two principal groups within Pseudopanax--the Arboreus group and the Crassifolius+Lessonii union--but how they are related to other genera remains unclear. There is, nevertheless, little compelling evidence against the monophyly of Pseudopanax, making unnecessary the recent re-segregation of the Arboreus group as Neopanax. The chloroplast data provided minimal additional resolution, although the position of P. linearis was discordant compared to other data. Analyses of the AFLP data strongly recovered each species, aside from the morphologically heterogeneous P. colensoi, and the two mainland species (P. arboreus and P. crassifolius) that each contained a nested island-endemic (P. kermadecensis and P. chathamicus, respectively). However, relationships amongst species within the two principal groups were poorly resolved. An example was the uncertainty of whether P. crassifolius grouped with P. lessonii and its allies, or the morphologically similar species it had been previously placed with. This in turn raises the issue of how hybridisation might affect phylogenies and the ability to reconstruct them, even when using multiple, independent markers.},

Previous studies have suggested its polyphyly, but have not had sufficient sampling to address the issue fully. To put an end to the out-dated concept of Hydrocotyloideae, we investigated the placement of 40 of the 42 genera once placed in the subfamily, using extensive taxon sampling across the entire order. Molecular phylogenies were constructed using plastid sequences of the rpl16 intron and the trnD-trnT regions and revealed at least six hydrocotyloid lineages dispersed across both families Apiaceae and Araliaceae. The most speciose of these clades corresponds to the recently erected subfamily Azorelloideae. Another lineage includes genera grouped in Mackinlayoideae, where relationships are well resolved. Platysace appears paraphyletic with respect to Homalosciadium, and their placement is well supported as a basal lineage in Apiaceae. The type genus, Hydrocotyle, belongs to a supported clade in Araliaceae. The placements of Hermas as sister to a clade consisting of Apiaceae subfamilies Apioideae and Saniculoideae, and of Choritaenia as sister to Lichtensteinia in a clade with affinities to both Apioideae and Saniculoideae, calls into question the circumscriptions of the two subfamilies. Finally, plastid data suggest that many former hydrocotyloid genera are non-monophyletic (e.g., Azorella, Schizeilema, and Eremocharis) and are in dire need of additional phylogenetic and taxonomic studies.},

At the same time, the evolutionary placement of ginseng (Panax ginseng) and the complex evolutionary history of the genus is poorly understood despite several molecular phylogenetic studies. In this study, we use a full plastome phylogenomic framework to resolve relationships in Panax and to identify molecular markers for species discrimination. RESULTS We used high-throughput sequencing of MBD2-Fc fractionated Panax DNA to supplement publicly available plastid genomes to create a phylogeny based on fully assembled and annotated plastid genomes from 60 accessions of 8 species. The plastome phylogeny based on a 163 kbp matrix resolves the sister relationship of Panax ginseng with P. quinquefolius. The closely related species P. vietnamensis is supported as sister of P. japonicus. The plastome matrix also shows that the markers trnC-rps16, trnS-trnG, and trnE-trnM could be used for unambiguous molecular identification of all the represented species in the genus. CONCLUSIONS MBD2 depletion reduces the cost of plastome sequencing, which makes it a cost-effective alternative to Sanger sequencing based DNA barcoding for molecular identification. The plastome phylogeny provides a robust framework that can be used to study the evolution of morphological characters and biosynthesis pathways of ginsengosides for phylogenetic bioprospecting. Molecular identification of ginseng species is essential for authenticating ginseng in international trade and it provides an incentive for manufacturers to create authentic products with verified ingredients.},

	abstract = {Sequences of the chloroplast trnC-trnD region and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA were obtained for all species of Panax L. (the ginseng plant genus, Araliaceae) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. The trnC-trnD phylogeny is congruent with the ITS phylogeny for the diploid taxa of Panax. This study is the first use of the trnC-trnD sequence data for phylogenetic analysis at the interspecific level. We evaluated this DNA region for its phylogenetic utility at the lower taxonomic level for flowering plants. The trnC-trnD region includes the trnC-petN intergenic spacer, the petN gene, the petN-psbM intergenic spacer, the psbM gene, and the psbM-trnD intergenic spacer. The petN and psbM genes are small, 90 and 104-114 bp across angiosperms, respectively, and have conserved sequences. We have designed universal amplification and sequencing primers within these two genes. Using these primers, we have successfully amplified the entire trnC-trnD region for a diversity of flowering plant groups, including Aralia L. (Araliaceae), Calycanthus L. (Calycanthaceae), Corylus L. (Betulaceae), Hamamelis L. (Hamamelidaceae), Hydrocotyle L. (Apiaceae), Illigera Blume (Hernandiaceae), Nelumbo Adans. (Nelumbonaceae), Nolana L. ex L.f. (Solanaceae), Prunus L. (Rosaceae), and Staphylea L. (Staphyleaceae). In Panax, the trnC-trnD region provides a similar number of informative phylogenetic characters as the ITS regions and a slightly higher number of informative characters than the chloroplast ndhF gene. We thus demonstrate the utility of the trnC-trnD region for lower-level phylogenetic studies in flowering plants.},

There is a considerable ecological diversity in the group, although most species occur in the humid forests of tropical America. Despite being relatively well-studied in taxonomic analyses, the relationships among the traditional morphological groups of the genus are not well-established, mainly regarding the three traditional subgenera, referred here as Philodendron sensu lato (s.l.), P. subg. Pteromischum, P. subg. Philodendron and P. subg. Meconostigma, which was recently recognized as a separate genus, Thaumatophyllum. Therefore, the present work evaluates the phylogenetic position and the monophyly of Philodendron s.l. and its three main subdivisions, and the sister groups within the Homalomena clade, which also includes the Neotropical genus Adelonema, the two Asian genera Homalomena and Furtadoa, and the two African genera Cercestis and Culcasia, by means of molecular phylogenetic approaches including chloroplast DNA (atpF-atpH, rpl32-trnL, trnQ-5'-rps16 and trnV-ndhC) and nuclear (ITS2) markers. The monophyly of Philodendron s.l. and its three lineages is confirmed and our analyses corroborate previous morphologic data indicating Thaumatophyllum as sister to the clade formed by P. subg.

Results of the molecular tree were useful for inferring subfamilial and tribal circumscription and evolution in Araceae. Our results show that family Araceae consists of five clades that correspond to the subfamilies traditionally recognized. Starting from the most basal clade, these correspond to subfamilies Gymnostachydoideae and Orontioideae (proto aroids), with Lemna sp. (Lemnaceae) embedded in the Araceae and sister to the true aroids consisting of Pothoideae sister to Monsteroideae, immediately sister to Lasioideae and Aroideae. There is less agreement with existing tribal classifications. Complex relationships exist between members of the Monsteroideae. Our results show that Rhaphidophora and Epipremnum are paraphyletic with species of Rhaphidophora sampled, forming three informal groups with other genera of the Monstereae.

Analyses were rooted with a representative sample of the closest outgroups, Pinellia and Typhonium, to rigorously test the monophyly of Arisaema. Sections in Arisaema are mostly based on leaf, stem, and inflorescence characters and, with one exception, are not rejected by the molecular data; however, statistical support for sectional relationships in the genus remains poor. Section Tortuosa, which includes eastern North American A. dracontium and Mexican A. macrospathum, is demonstrably polyphyletic. The third New World species, A. triphyllum, also occurs in eastern North America and groups with a different Asian clade than do A. dracontium/A. macrospathum. The genus thus appears to have entered North America twice. Fossil infructescences similar to those of A. triphyllum are known from approximately 18 million-year-old deposits in Washington State and can serve to calibrate a molecular clock. Constraining the age of A. triphyllum to 18 million years (my) and applying either a semiparametric or an ultrametric clock model to the combined data yields an age of approximately 31-49 my for the divergence of A. dracontium/A. macrospathum from their Asian relatives and of 19-32 my for the divergence between African A. schimperianum and a Tibetan/Nepalese relative. The genus thus provides an example of the Oligocene/Miocene floristic links between East Africa, Arabia, the Himalayan region, China, and North America. The phylogeny also suggests secondary loss of the environmental sex determination strategy that characterizes all arisaemas except for two subspecies of A. flavum, which have consistently bisexual spathes. These subspecies are tetraploid and capable of selfing, while a third subspecies of A. flavum is diploid and retains the sex-changing strategy. In the molecular trees, the sex-changing subspecies is sister to the two non-sex-changing ones, and the entire species is not basal in the genus.},

Symplocarpus is disjunctly distributed in eastern Asia (3 spp.) and eastern North America (1 sp.); Lysichiton has an intercontinental discontinuous distribution in eastern Asia (1 sp.) and northwestern North America (1 sp.); and the monotypic Orontium is restricted to eastern North America. Phylogenetic analysis of the trnL-F and ndhF sequences supports (1) the monophyly of both Symplocarpus and Lysichiton, (2) the sister-group relationship of Symplocarpus and Lysichiton, and (3) the clade of Orontium, Symplocarpus, and Lysichiton. Although Symplocarpus shows a much wider disjunction than Lysichiton, the estimated divergence time of the former [4.49+/-1.69 or 6.88+/-4.18 million years ago (mya)] was similar to that of the latter (4.02+/-1.60 or 7.18+/-4.33 mya) based on the penalized likelihood and the Bayesian dating methods, respectively. Eastern Asia was suggested to be the ancestral area of the Symplocarpus-Lysichiton clade based on the dispersal-vicariance analysis. Our biogeographic results support independent migrations of Symplocarpus and Lysichiton across the Bering land bridge in the late Tertiary (Pliocene/late Miocene). Fossil evidence suggests Orontioideae dated back to the late Cretaceous in the temperate Northern Hemisphere (72 mya). The relative rate test shows similar substitution rates of the trnL-F sequences between the proto and the true aroids, although the latter has substantially higher species diversity. The proto Araceae perhaps suffered from a higher rate of extinction in the temperate zone associated with periods of climatic cooling in the Tertiary.},

Several species, including giant taro, Alocasia macrorrhizos, and Chinese taro, Alocasia cucullata, are important food plants or ornamentals. We investigated the biogeography of this genus using plastid and nuclear DNA sequences (5200 nucleotides) from 78 accessions representing 71 species, plus 25 species representing 16 genera of the Pistia clade to which Alocasia belongs. Divergence times were inferred under strict and relaxed clock models, and ancestral areas with Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Alocasia is monophyletic and sister to Colocasiagigantea from the SE Asian mainland, whereas the type species of Colocasia groups with Steudnera and Remusatia, requiring taxonomic realignments. Nuclear and plastid trees show topological conflict, with the nuclear tree reflecting morphological similarities, the plastid tree species' geographic proximity, suggesting chloroplast capture. The ancestor of Alocasia diverged from its mainland sister group c. 24 million years ago, and Borneo then played a central role in the expansion of Alocasia: 11-13 of 18-19 inferred dispersal events originated on Borneo. The Philippines were reached from Borneo 4-5 times in the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene, and the Asian mainland 6-7 times in the Pliocene. Domesticated giant taro originated on the Philippines, Chinese taro on the Asian mainland.},

However, phylogenetic ambiguity near the root of the tree precludes answering questions about the early evolution of the family. We use Illumina sequencing technology and reference based assembly to resolve the remaining questions in the deep phylogeny of Araceae. We sampled 32 genera and obtained 7 from GenBank (including an outgroup), representing 42 of 44 major clades described in Cusimano et al. (2011). A subsequent phylogenomic analysis based on mitochondrial data was performed to test congruence between plastid and mitochondrial data for phylogenetic inference. Plastid sequences produced strongly supported phylogenies. In contrast, mitochondrial phylogenies were weakly supported and incongruent with chloroplast data (Templeton test, p⩽0.0001), although several smaller clades were recovered. New strongly-supported clades seen here are: (1) Anubias and Montrichardia, excluding Calla, form a clade that is sister to the Zantedeschia clade; (2) the South African genus Zantedeschia is sister to the Old World Anchomanes clade; and (3) within the Zantedeschia clade, Philodendron is sister to the rest. Calla and Schismatoglottis form a clade at the base of one of two major clades in Aroideae based on complete chloroplast sequences. Although statistical support is weak, morphological and cytological features support this topology.},

Considering the small size of previously included genera in the tribe (10 geophytic genera, none with more than 15 described species), generic circumscription has been considered troublesome. To address these issues, we sequenced two cpDNA markers (matK and trnL-F) and reconstructed the phylogeny of the tribe using two approaches: Maximum parsimony and Bayesian Inference. We also evaluated the effect of adding phenotypic characters in a "total evidence" analysis. Our results confirm the previous suggestion that the two non-geophytic genera Dieffenbachia and Bognera should be included in Spathicarpeae, but the precise placement of Bognera within the tribe is still unresolved. Our results also support the segregation of Asterostigma pavonii and Asterostigma integrifolium, recently described as new monospecific genera (Incarum and Croatiella, respectively). The reconstructed phylogenies suggest that the invasion of the Andean range by the Spathicarpeae occurred in at least two independent events.

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The first family-wide molecular phylogeny of the Araceae, a family of about 3800 published species in 120 genera, became available in 1995, followed by a cladistic analysis of morpho-anatomical data in 1997. The most recent and comprehensive family-wide molecular phylogeny was published in 2008 and included species from 102 genera. We reanalyzed the molecular data with a more complete genus sampling and compared the resulting phylogeny with morphological and anatomical data, with a view to contributing to a new formal classification of the Araceae. METHODS We analyzed 113 aroid genera and 4494 aligned nucleotides that resulted from adding 11 genera to the 2008 molecular matrix. We also analyzed 81 morphological characters in the context of the molecular phylogeny, using an extended version of the 1997 morpho-anatomical data set. KEY RESULTS The resulting maximum-likelihood phylogeny is well resolved and supported, and most of the 44 larger clades also have morphological or anatomical synapomorphies as well as ecological or geographic cohesion. Of the 44 clades, 16 are here newly circumscribed and informally named. However, some relationships remain poorly supported within the Aroideae subfamily. The most problematic placement is Calla within Aroideae, which conflicts with the distribution of morphological, anatomical, and palynological character states. CONCLUSIONS The comparison of the molecular analysis with morphological and anatomical data presented here represents an important basis for a new formal classification for the Araceae and for the understanding of the evolution of this ancient family, a monocot group known in the fossil record from the early Cretaceous.},

Our analyses confirm the position of Lemna and its allies (formerly Lemnaceae) within Araceae as the well-supported sister group of all aroids except Gymnostachydoideae and Orontioideae. The last two subfamilies form the sister clade of the rest of the family. Monophyly of subfamilies Orontioideae, Pothoideae, Monsteroideae, and Lasioideae is supported, but Aroideae are paraphyletic if Calla is maintained in its own subfamily (Calloideae). Our results suggest expansion of the recently proposed subfamily Zamioculcadoideae (Zamioculcas, Gonatopus) to include Stylochaeton and identify problems in the current delimitation of tribes Anadendreae, Heteropsideae, and Monstereae (Monsteroideae), Caladieae/Zomicarpeae, and Colocasieae (Aroideae). Canalization of traits of the spathe and spadix considered typical of Araceae evolved after the split of Gymnostachydoideae, Orontioideae, and Lemnoideae. An association with aquatic habitats is a plesiomorphic attribute in Araceae, occurring in the helophytic Orontioideae and free-floating Lemnoideae, but evolving independently in various derived aroid lineages including free-floating Pistia (Aroideae).},

Nuclear and plastid trees are highly incongruent and the nuclear tree is more compatible with current taxonomic classifications than the plastid one. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of extant species is dated from the Miocene, although the Ilex stem lineage can be traced back to the late Cretaceous, according to fossil records. This suggests extensive lineage extinctions between the Cretaceous and Miocene and may also explain the difficulties encountered in defining the relationships between Ilex and its closest relatives. The MRCA ancestral area was identified as being in the North Hemisphere (North America and/or East Asia). Several bidirectional North America/East Asia and North America/South America dispersal events are proposed to explain observed geographic and phylogenetic patterns.

Earlier studies inferred a Madagascan or Australian origin for the genus. Aponogeton-like pollen is documented from the Late Cretaceous of Wyoming, the early mid-Eocene of Canada, and the late mid-Eocene of Greenland. We obtained nuclear and plastid DNA sequences for 42 species and generated a time-calibrated phylogeny, rooted on appropriate outgroups. Statistical biogeographic analyses were carried out with or without the fossils incorporated in the phylogeny. The recent-most common ancestor of living Aponogetonaceae appears to date to the mid-Eocene and to have lived in Madagascar or Africa (but not Australia). Three transoceanic dispersal events from Africa/Madagascar to Asia sometime during the Miocene could explain the observed species relationships. As inferred in earlier studies, an ancient Australian species is sister to all other Aponogetonaceae, while the remaining Australian species stem from an Asian ancestor that arrived about 5million years ago. The family's ancient Northern Hemisphere fossil record and deepest extant divergence between a single Australian species and an Africa/Madagascar clade are statistically well-supported and rank among the most unusual patters in the biogeography of flowering plants.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Of the c. 450 families of flowering plants, only two are left "unplaced" in the most recent APG classification of angiosperms. One of these is the Apodanthaceae, a clade of c. 19 holoparasitic species in two or three genera occurring in North and South America, Africa, the Near East, and Australia. Because of lateral gene transfer between Apodanthaceae and their hosts it has been difficult to infer the family's true closest relatives. RESULTS Here we report a phylogenetic analysis of 16 accessions representing six species of Apodanthaceae from the United States, Chile, Iran, and Australia, using the mitochondrial matR gene and the nuclear 18S gene. Data matrices include 190 matR sequences from up to 95 families in 39 orders of flowering plants and 197 18S sequences from 101 families representing the 16 orders of rosids. Analyses were performed at the nucleotide and at the amino acid level. Both gene trees agree with angiosperm phylogenies found in other studies using more genes. Apodanthaceae and the seven families of the order Cucurbitales form a clade with 100\% bootstrap support from matR and 56\% from 18 S. In addition, the Apodanthaceae and Cucurbitales matR gene sequences uniquely share two non-synonymous codon changes and one synonymous change, as well as a codon insertion, already found by Barkman et al. (2007). CONCLUSIONS Apodanthaceae belong in the Cucurbitales with which they share inferior ovaries, parietal placentation and a dioecious mating system, traits that are ancestral in Cucurbitales and which can now be interpreted as possible synapomorphies of an enlarged order Cucurbitales. The occurrence of Apodanthaceae in the Americas, Africa, the Near East, and Australia, and their adaptation to distantly related host species in the Fabaceae and Salicaceae suggest a long evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {Gene trees of holoparasitic plants usually show distinctly longer branch lengths than seen in photosynthetic closest relatives. Such substitution rate jumps have made it difficult to infer the absolute divergence times of parasites. An additional problem is that parasite clades often lack a fossil record. Using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences of Apodanthaceae, a worldwide family of endoparasites living inside Fabaceae and Salicaceae, we compared several dating approaches: (i) an uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) model calibrated with outgroup fossils, (ii) ages of host lineages as a maximal age in an UCLN model, (iii) user-assigned local clocks, and (iv) outgroup-fossil-calibrated random local clocks (RLC) with varying prior probabilities on the number of permitted rate changes (RLCu and RLCp models), a variable that has never been explored. The resulting dated phylogenies include all 10 species of the family, three in Australia, one in Iran, one in Africa, and the remainder in the Americas. All clock models infer a drastic rate jump between nonparasitic outgroups and Apodanthaceae, but since they distribute the rate heterogeneity differently, they result in much-different age estimates. Bayes factors using path and stepping-stone sampling indicated that the RLCp model fit poorly, while for matR, topologically unconstrained RLCu and UCLN models did not differ significantly and for 18S, the UCLN model was preferred. Under the equally well fitting models, the Apodanthaceae appear to be a relatively old clade, with a stem age falling between 65 and 81my, the divergence of Apodanthes from Pilostyles between 36 and 57my ago, and the crown age of the Australian clade 8-18my ago. In our study system, host-age calibrations did not yield well-constrained results, but they may work better in other parasite clades. For small data sets where statistical convergence can be reached even with complex models, random local clocks should be explored as an alternative to the exclusive reliance on UCLN clocks.},

Our phylogenetic analysis revealed two monophyletic groups; one consisted of seven taxa of Tylophora and Vincetoxicum inamoenum, Vincetoxicum magnificum and Vincetoxicum macrophyllum (Clade I) and the other consisted of 17 accessions of Vincetoxicum (Clade II). The monophyly of the genus Vincetoxicum was not supported. Although many nucleotide substitutions were observed in Clade I, the genetic differentiation within Clade II was small. Low genetic diversification but considerable morphological divergence suggests that the species in Clade II had undergone rapid diversification. Although most species in Clade I have tiny flowers, those in Clade II have larger and more nectariferous ones. Thus, we hypothesized that the rapid morphological radiation in Clade II may have been due to the gaining of floral characters such as large flowers and large amounts of nectar corresponding to diverse pollinators.},

We here infer major species groups in the genus based on combined sequences from the chloroplast atpB-rbcL spacer, the trnL region, and nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS region for 42 taxa of Hoya and close relatives. To assess levels of ITS polymorphism, ITS sequences for a third of the accessions were obtained by cloning. Most ITS clones grouped by species, indicating that speciation in Hoya usually predates ITS duplication. One ITS sequence of H. carnosa, however, grouped with a sequence of the morphologically similar H. pubicalyx, pointing to recent hybridization or the persistence of paralogous copies through a speciation event. The topology resulting from the combined chloroplast and nuclear data recovers some morphology-based sections, such as Acanthostemma and Eriostemma, as well as a well-supported Australian/New Guinean clade. The combined data also suggest that morphological adaptations for ant-symbiosis evolved at least three times within Hoya.},

	abstract = {Crown clade Apocynaceae comprise seven primary lineages of lianas, shrubs, and herbs with a diversity of pollen aggregation morphologies including monads, tetrads, and pollinia, making them an ideal group for investigating the evolution and function of pollen packaging. Traditional molecular systematic approaches utilizing small amounts of sequence data have failed to resolve relationships along the spine of the crown clade, a likely ancient rapid radiation. The previous best estimate of the phylogeny was a five-way polytomy, leaving ambiguous the homology of aggregated pollen in two major lineages, the Periplocoideae, which possess pollen tetrads, and the milkweeds (Secamonoideae plus Asclepiadoideae), which possess pollinia. To assess whether greatly increased character sampling would resolve these relationships, a plastome sequence data matrix was assembled for 13 taxa of Apocynaceae, including nine newly generated complete plastomes, one partial new plastome, and three previously reported plastomes, collectively representing all primary crown clade lineages and outgroups. The effects of phylogenetic noise, long-branch attraction, and model selection (linked versus unlinked branch lengths among data partitions) were evaluated in a hypothesis-testing framework based on Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests. Discrimination among alternative crown clade resolutions was affected by all three factors. Exclusion of the noisiest alignment positions and topologies influenced by long-branch attraction resulted in a trichotomy along the spine of the crown clade consisting of Rhabdadenia+the Asian clade, Baisseeae+milkweeds, and Periplocoideae+the New World clade. Parsimony reconstruction on all optimal topologies after noise exclusion unambiguously supports parallel evolution of aggregated pollen in Periplocoideae (tetrads) and milkweeds (pollinia). Our phylogenomic approach has greatly advanced the resolution of one of the most perplexing radiations in Apocynaceae, providing the basis for study of convergent floral morphologies and their adaptive value.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The number of genera included in Apocynaceae subfamily Periplocoideae is a matter of debate. DNA sequences are used here as an independent dataset to clarify generic relationships and classification of the tuberous periplocoid genera and to address the question of the phylogenetic interpretation of pollinia formation in Schlechterella. METHODS Representatives of nearly all African and Malagasy genera of Periplocoideae possessing root tubers were analysed using ITS and plastid DNA sequence characters. RESULTS Sequence data from non-coding molecular markers (ITS of nrDNA and the trnT-L and trnL-F spacers as well as the trnL intron of plastid DNA) give support for a broad taxonomic concept of Raphionacme including Pentagonanthus. Together with Schlechterella, which is sister to Raphionacme, all Raphionacme-like taxa form a derived monophyletic group of somewhat diverse species. Sister to the Schlechterella/Raphionacme clade is a clade comprising Stomatostemma and the not truly tuberous vine Mondia. In the combined analysis, sister to these two clades combined is a clade formed by Petopentia natalensis and Periploca. CONCLUSIONS The recent inclusion of the monotypic South African Petopentia in the monotypic Malagasy endemic Ischnolepis is to be rejected. The Malagasy Camptocarpus is sister to the remainder of Periplocoideae in the ITS and combined analyses, and a Malagasy origin for the subfamily is discussed.},

Of the temperate clades, one is restricted to the Far East, the other one (Vincetoxicum s. str. Clade) extends into Europe, but their ranges overlap in Central China and Japan. Three species invasive in North America, V. hirundinaria, V. nigrum and V. rossicum, are members of the Vincetoxicum s. str. Clade. We explore the prerequisites for the range expansion in the Vincetoxicum s. str. Clade performing Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses on sequences of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the nuclear external transcribed spacer region (ETS), and five plastid markers. The resulting phylogeny is used to conduct biogeographic analysis using BioGeoBEARS to reconstruct ancestral species ranges. Moreover, we map the known occurrences of two rare characters in Asclepiadoideae, the possession of phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids and reported cases of autogamy onto our phylogeny. Finally, we have conducted ecological niche modelling using Maxent on a total of 220 spatially unique occurrences of nine Vincetoxicum s. str. species spanning more than 4,000 km along the east-west gradient to learn about the climatic conditions along the presumed migration route. Our results indicate a north-westward migration in Vincetoxicum s. str. along the Asian mountain chains to Europe. Climatic preferences of the nine species sampled are dissimilar, except for the common exposure to at least one month of subfreezing temperatures, indicating a rather wide climatic tolerance for the clade as a whole. The three species invasive in North America belong to the northern Eurasian subclade and show the rare combination of phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids and autogamy.},

They occur in and around the semi-arid, mainly tropical parts of the Old World. For 146 species (around half of the total) from most of the geographic range of the genera, we analysed data from two nuclear and five plastid regions. The evolution of Ceropegia is very complex, with at least 13 mostly well-supported lineages, one of which is sister to the ±350 species of stapeliads. Species of Brachystelma have evolved at least four times, with most of them nested within two separate major lineages. So, neither Brachystelma nor Ceropegia is monophyletic. We recover a broad trend, in two separate major lineages, from slender climbers to small, geophytic herbs. Several clades are recovered in which all species possess an underground tuber. Small, erect, non-climbing, geophytic species of Ceropegia with a tuber are nested among species of Brachystelma. Consequently, the distinctive tubular flowers used to define Ceropegia do not reflect relationships. This re-iterates the great floral plasticity in the Ceropegieae, already established for the stapeliads. Both major lineages exhibit a trend from tubular flowers with faint, often fruity odours, pollinated by very small Dipteran flies, to flatter flowers often with a bad odour, pollinated by larger flies. Most of the diversity in Brachystelma and Ceropegia is recent and arose within the last 3my against a background of increased aridification or extreme climatic variability during the Pliocene. In the ingroup, diversity is highest in Southern Africa, followed by Tropical East Africa and other arid parts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and India. Many disjunctions are revealed and these are best explained by recent, long distance dispersal. In Africa, the diversity arises from the presence of many different lineages over wide areas but there is also evidence of closely related species growing together with different pollinators.},

Here we sampled 192 species (i.e. nearly two thirds of the total) from across the full geographic range of the group and analysed data from the two nuclear regions (nuclear ribosomal ITS and ncpGS) and five plastid regions (psbA-trnH intergenic spacer, rps16 intron, trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, trnS-trnG intergenic region and the non-coding rpl32-trnL region). We find that the stapeliads radiated first in the northern hemisphere from Africa to southern Europe and Myanmar. This radiation subtends a grade of minor clades in the south-western corner of the African continent. These were followed by a single clade containing major radiation back across Africa from South Africa to tropical Arabia (but no further east than Dhofar, Oman), which includes also a single early spread into Madagascar. We establish the monophyly of many of the genera, such as Echidnopsis Hook.f., Hoodia Hook., Huernia R. Br., Piaranthus R. Br., Rhytidocaulon P.R.O. Bally and Tridentea Haw., but find that Duvalia Haw., Orbea Haw., Stapelia L. and Tromotriche Haw. are polyphyletic. We show that in certain vegetative features, there is broad cohesion across clades. Florally, on the other hand, the stapeliads exhibit considerable plasticity and we are able to show that very differently shaped flowers as well as large and small flowers evolved repeatedly among closely related species.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the angiosperm families Apiaceae and Araliaceae (order Apiales) has been difficult to resolve, due in large part to problems associated with taxa characterized by a mixture of features typical of both families. Among such confounding groups are the araliads Delarbrea, Pseudosciadium, Myodocarpus, Mackinlaya, and Apiopetalum and many members of Apiaceae subfamily Hydrocotyloideae. Traditional systems have often envisioned these taxa as phyletic intermediates or bridges between the two families. To reevaluate the phylogenetic position of the "intermediate" araliad genera, molecular data were collected from nuclear (rDNA ITS) and plastid (matK) sequences from a complete or near-complete sampling of species in each genus. When analyzed with samples representing the other major clades now recognized within Apiales, results confirm and expand the findings of previously published studies. The five araliad "intermediates" are placed within two well-supported clades clearly segregated from the "core" groups of both Apiaceae and Araliaceae. These segregate clades closely parallel traditional definitions of the araliad tribes Myodocarpeae (Delarbrea, Pseudosciadium, and Myodocarpus) and Mackinlayeae (Mackinlaya and Apiopetalum), and relationships among the species within these clades are largely supported by morphological and anatomical data. Based on these results, Myodocarpeae and Mackinlayeae may best be treated as distinct families. This approach would render four monophyletic groups within Apiales, to which a fifth, Pittosporaceae, cannot at present be excluded. Sampling of taxa from Hydrocotyloideae remains preliminary, but results confirm previous studies indicating the polyphyly of this subfamily: hydrocotyloid taxa may be found in no fewer than three major clades in Apiales.},

	abstract = {China contains some of the world's greatest diversity of Apiaceae (Umbelliferae), with ten endemic genera. Our previous investigation into the phylogenetic relationships of Chinese Apiaceae subfamily Apioideae, based exclusively on nrDNA ITS sequences, revealed several major clades heretofore unrecognized in the subfamily and confirmed the phylogenetic placements of five endemic genera. To further elucidate relationships among Chinese Apioideae, ascertain the phylogenetic placements of the remaining endemic genera, and test hypotheses of relationships proposed in our earlier study, additional taxa were examined for ITS and, for smaller sets of accessions, cpDNA rpl16 and rps16 intron sequence variation. These ITS and cpDNA data matrices comprised 158 and 131 accessions, respectively, with 110 accessions included in the analysis of combined ITS and cpDNA data. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of partitioned ITS and chloroplast data sets resulted in highly consistent phylogenies, whereas analyses of combined molecular data resulted in trees of greatest resolution and overall branch support. Two major clades identified in our previous study are recognized at the tribal level: Komarovieae J. Zhou \& S. R. Downie trib. nov. and Chamaesieae J. Zhou \& F. D. Pu trib. nov. The monotypic tribe Chamaesieae represents one of the earliest diverging lineages of subfamily Apioideae in Asia. The Acronema and East Asia clades of previous circumscription are each expanded. Of the five Chinese endemic genera not examined previously, Chaerophyllopsis finds affinity within tribe Scandiceae subtribe Scandicinae, Chuanminshen allies with Changium and Cyclorhiza in tribe Komarovieae, Harrysmithia falls within the Acronema Clade, Melanosciadium embeds in Angelica in tribe Selineae, and Dickinsia is confirmed as a member of Apiaceae subfamily Azorelloideae. The cpDNA-based phylogenies are not sufficiently resolved in their distal portions to elucidate the tribal placement of the endemic genus Nothosmyrnium, whereas the ITS trees strongly indicate an affinity with tribe Pimpinelleae. The affinities of several Chinese endemic species are also addressed. Peucedanum delavayi, for example, is phylogenetically distant from Sinodielsia and Meeboldia, genera with which it has been allied previously, and shows close affinity to three Chinese species of Ligusticum in tribe Selineae. Aside from providing a framework for taxonomic revisions, the phylogenetic structure recovered in this study for subfamily Apioideae will lay the foundation for future investigations of evolutionary patterns of morphological characters and biogeography.},

	abstract = {DNA barcodes have been increasingly used in authentication of medicinal plants, while their wide application in materia medica is limited in their accuracy due to incomplete sampling of species and absence of identification for materia medica. In this study, 95 leaf accessions of 23 species (including one variety) and materia medica of three Pharmacopoeia-recorded species of Angelica in China were collected to evaluate the effectiveness of four DNA barcodes (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA and ITS). Our results showed that ITS provided the best discriminatory power by resolving 17 species as monophyletic lineages without shared alleles and exhibited the largest barcoding gap among the four single barcodes. The phylogenetic analysis of ITS showed that Levisticum officinale and Angelica sinensis were sister taxa, which indicates that L. officinale should be considered as a species of Angelica. The combination of ITS + rbcL + matK + trnH-psbA performed slight better discriminatory power than ITS, recovering 23 species without shared alleles and 19 species as monophyletic clades in ML tree. Authentication of materia medica using ITS revealed that the decoction pieces of A. sinensis and A. biserrata were partially adulterated with those of L. officinale, and the temperature around 80 °C processing A. dahurica decoction pieces obviously reduced the efficiency of PCR and sequencing. The examination of two cultivated varieties of A. dahurica from different localities indicated that the four DNA barcodes are inefficient for discriminating geographical authenticity of conspecific materia medica. This study provides an empirical paradigm in identification of medicinal plants and their materia medica using DNA barcodes.},

Phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses were carried out applying sequences of two nuclear and nine plastid loci from eleven recognized Osmorhiza species. The nuclear ITS and ETS and the plastid data fully resolved the infrageneric relationships, yet the two phylogenies were largely incongruent. Comparisons of nuclear and plastid phylogenies revealed several interspecific chloroplast transfer events in Osmorhiza, one of which involved an extinct or an unsampled lineage. This genus was inferred to have originated in the Old World during the late Miocene (11.02mya, 95\% HPD: 9.13-12.93mya), and the crown of the genus was dated to be in the late Miocene (5.51mya, 95\% HPD: 2.81-8.37mya). Species of Osmorhiza were inferred to have migrated from the Old World into North America across the Bering land bridge during the late Miocene, and they then diversified in the New World through multiple dispersal and divergence events. The intraspecific amphitropical disjunctions between North and South America, and the eastern and western North American disjunctions within O. berteroi and O. depauperata were hypothesized to be via recent long-distance dispersals most likely facilitated by birds.},

One hundred accessions were analyzed, including 86 specimens of Sium s.l., representing all taxa throughout their geographical range. The phylogenetic analyses showed that Afrocarum and the African and St. Helena species of Sium were nested within Berula forming the Berula s.l. clade. The remaining species of Sium constituted a weakly supported Sium s.s. clade. The cultivated S. sisarum is closely related to the western Asian S. sisaroideum. The divergence of Sium s.s. from Berula s.l., estimated under the assumption of a molecular clock and using a substitution rate of 0.61\% per million years, took place around 10.4 million years ago. Dispersal-vicariance analysis suggested that the biogeographic pattern of this group resulted from simple vicariance and eventual migration to adjacent areas rather than from long-distance dispersal. The ancestral area of Sium s.l. was probably western Palearctic. The dispersal of Berula to North America occurred ca. 3 million years ago, possibly by island hopping. The migration of S. suave to North America took place ca 0.6 million years ago through Beringia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The genus Bupleurum has long been recognized as a natural group, but its infrageneric classification is controversial and has not yet been studied in the light of sequence data. METHODS Phylogenetic relationships among 32 species (35 taxa) of the genus Bupleurum were investigated by comparative sequencing of the ITS region of the 18-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat. Exemplar taxa from all currently accepted sections and subsections of the genus were included, along with outgroups from four other early branching Apioideae genera (Anginon, Heteromorpha, Physospermum and Pleurospermum). RESULTS Phylogenies generated by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and neighbour-joining methods show similar topologies, demonstrating monophyly of Bupleurum and the division of the genus into two major clades. This division is also supported by analysis of the 5.8S coding sequence alone. The first branching clade is formed by all the species of the genus with pinnate-reticulate veined leaves and B. rigidum with a unique type of leaf venation. The other major clade includes the remaining species studied, all of which have more or less parallel-veined leaves. CONCLUSIONS These phylogenetic results do not agree with any previous classifications of the genus. Molecular data also suggest that the endemic Macaronesian species B. salicifolium is a neoendemic, as the sequence divergence between the populations in Madeira and Canary Islands, and closer mainland relatives in north-west Africa is small. All endemic north-west African taxa are included in a single unresolved but well-supported clade, and the low nucleotide variation of ITS suggests a recent radiation within this group. The only southern hemisphere species, B. mundii (southern Africa), is shown to be a neoendemic, apparently closely related to B. falcatum, a Eurasian species.},

We report that the ETS region evolves at a slightly faster rate and has a higher percentage of parsimony informative characters than that of ITS and all chloroplast DNA loci examined to date.

	abstract = {Azorella, Laretia and Mulinum are taxonomically complex, and good candidates to study evolutionary radiations in the Andes and the importance of hybridizations. Previous phylogenetic studies of subfamily Azorelloideae agree that Azorella and Mulinum as currently conceived are not monophyletic, and hence a revision of their circumscription is necessary. However, these phylogenies were based only on chloroplast DNA sequence data. Here, phylogenetic relationships within Azorelloideae were inferred using sequence data from five chloroplast DNA (rps16 intron, trnQ-rps16, rps16-trnKUUU 5' -exon, trnGGCC-trnSGCU and rpL32-trnLUAG), and from nuclear rDNA ITS regions to assess the monophyly of Azorella and Mulinum and discuss generic re-circumscriptions, determine hybridization and radiation events, identify and characterize important lineages, and propose hypotheses on evolution of key morphological characters. In total, 121 accessions of Azorelloideae were analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses of the different genomes were conducted separately and combined, with and without indels, using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. To analyze the incongruence between plastid and nuclear-derived trees a consensus network from strongly supported nodes from cpDNA and ITS trees was constructed. Internode certainty values were calculated to evaluate the reliability of the relationships estimated from the individual cpDNA and ITS data sets and to examine the degree of conflict within the total evidence data set. Azorella and Mulinum were confirmed as not monophyletic. Except three Azorella species, the remaining azorellas, all species of Mulinum, and Laretia form a monophyletic group, designated here as Andean-Patagonian. The three species of Azorella that are not part of the Andean-Patagonian lineage are grouped together with Huanaca and Schizeilema in another lineage, designated here as Austral. Within the Andean-Patagonian clade, three major lineages can be recognized: Diversifolia, Trifurcata, and Spinosum. Each of these lineages have different leaf morpho-anatomies, Diversifolia species being more mesomorphic compared to species of Trifurcata, and species of Spinosum being the most xeromorphic. Hybridizations have been important in the evolution of the group, especially within Diversifolia, with at least six reticulation events resulting in putative homoploid and allopolyploid hybrid species. Evidence from branch lengths and low sequence divergences suggest a rapid radiation in the Spinosum group, probably associated with the acquisition of wings in the fruits.},

Results of these analyses corroborate a monophyletic Angelica (Angelica sensu stricto) upon the inclusion of Coelopleurum, Czernaevia, and one of two examined species of Ostericum, but with the exclusion of several species previously attributable to Angelica. Angelica oncosepala and A. likiangensis arise within the genus Heracleum in tribe Tordylieae; the former is recognized under its original name, Heracleum oncosepalum. Angelica sinensis, A. tianmuensis and A. paeoniifolia arise within the Sinodielsia clade of previous circumscription, closely related to Levisticum officinale. Angelica anomala is a sister group to Ostericum grosseserratum in the previously delimited Acronema clade. Angelica apaensis and A. decursiva, taxa whose phylogenetic affinities have previously been controversial, are confirmed within Angelica. Northeast Asia (including Japan, northeast China, Korea and adjacent areas of Russia), Western Europe, and North America are inferred to be ancestral areas of Angelica based on optimal solutions of a dispersal-vicariance analysis, with the Hengduan Mountains likely providing a refugium for Angelica during the latter part of the Tertiary.},

	abstract = {The Arracacia clade (Apiaceae, Apioideae) is a heterogeneous assemblage of 12 genera, comprising 111 known species distributed in high montane temperate and sub-alpine habitats of meso- and South America. Previous studies have indicated that the genera Arracacia, Coulterophytum, and Prionosciadium are polyphyletic, but for the most part relationships among the members of the clade are largely unknown. Initially, cladistic analyses of nrDNA ITS sequences were carried out on 212 accessions (122 taxa), representing 92 species of the Arracacia clade and outgroups from the closely-related páramo genera Cotopaxia, Niphogeton, and Perissocoeleum and members of the Perennial Endemic North American clade and its allies. Using the ITS results to inform sampling of a small subset of taxa, a pilot study examining the phylogenetic utility of 20 noncoding chloroplast loci was subsequently performed to identify those regions most useful at resolving relationships. A cost-benefit analysis determined that five loci (trnQ-5'rps16, trnD-trnT, rpl32-trnL, psbD-trnT, ndhA intron) would maximize resolution and branch support in the clade. Cladistic analyses of four of these loci (trnQ-5'rps16, trnD-trnT, rpl32-trnL, ndhA intron) and the ITS region, separately and combined, revealed that Arracacia, Coaxana, Coulterophytum, Prionosciadium, and Rhodosciadium are each polyphyletic and that Donnellsmithia and Myrrhidendron are each monophyletic. Although most relationships in the Arracacia clade and among the closely-related genera Cotopaxia, Niphogeton, and Perissocoeleum are poorly resolved and supported, ten groups are recognized for future revisionary studies. Polyploidy and rapid species radiation have likely confounded generic circumscriptions and interpretation of relationships.},

Studying phylogenetics of the plant species in this widespread ecosystem can provide insights into the historical biogeographic processes that have shaped the global biodiversity. The trans-Pacific disjunct alpine genus Oreomyrrhis (Apiaceae) was investigated using nrDNA ITS sequences to test the taxonomic and biogeographic hypotheses. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference revealed that species of Oreomyrrhis form a weakly supported monophyletic clade that is nested within Chaerophyllum sect. Chaerophyllum (subtribe Scandicinae, tribe Scandiceae). The optimal solutions of dispersal-vicariance analysis indicate that the ancestor of Chaerophyllum sect. Chaerophyllum (including Oreomyrrhis) was distributed in Eurasia and subsequently dispersed to North America and southern Pacific Rim. Based on dating using ITS sequence variation, these dispersal events were most likely recent, probably during late Tertiary to Quaternary. The structure of the ITS haplotype network suggests that a rapid range expansion via long-distance dispersal had been crucial in generating the trans-Pacific disjunction of Oreomyrrhis. Furthermore, evolution toward smaller mericarp size and a transition from outcrossing to selfing during Oreomyrrhis's evolution might have increased the chances for long-distance dispersal, facilitating its range expansion and occupation on alpine environments.},

We expand previous molecular phylogenetic analyses of the family by considering all but three of the approximately 38 genera native to southern Africa, including all genera whose members, save one, have a woody habit. Representatives of five other genera are included because they may be closely related to these southern African taxa. Chloroplast DNA rps16 intron and/or nuclear rDNA ITS sequences for 154 accessions are analyzed using maximum parsimony, Bayesian, and maximum likelihood methods. Within Apioideae, two major clades hitherto unrecognized in the subfamily are inferred. The monogeneric Lichtensteinia clade is sister group to all other members of the subfamily, whereas the Annesorhiza clade (Annesorhiza, Chamarea, and Itasina) plus Molopospermum (and Astydamia in the ITS trees) are the successive sister group to all Apioideae except Lichtensteinia. Tribe Heteromorpheae is expanded to include Pseudocarum, "Oreofraga" ined., and five genera endemic to Madagascar. The southern African origin of subfamily Apioideae is corroborated (with subsequent migration northward into Eurasia along two dispersal routes), and the positions of the herbaceous Lichtensteinia and Annesorhiza clades within the subfamily suggest, surprisingly, that its ancestor was herbaceous, not woody.},

	abstract = {Eryngium is the largest and arguably the most taxonomically complex genus in the family Apiaceae. Infrageneric relationships within Eryngium were inferred using sequence data from the chloroplast DNA trnQ-trnK 5'-exon and nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS regions to test previous hypotheses of subgeneric relationships, explain distribution patterns, reconstruct ancestral morphological features, and elucidate the evolutionary processes that gave rise to this speciose genus. In total, 157 accessions representing 118 species of Eryngium, 15 species of Sanicula (including the genus Hacquetia that was recently reduced to synonymy) and the monotypic Petagnaea were analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods. Both separate and simultaneous analyses of plastid and nuclear data sets were carried out because of the prevalence of polyploids and hybrids within the genus. Eryngium is confirmed as monophyletic and is divided into two redefined subgenera: Eryngium subgenus Eryngium and E. subgenus Monocotyloidea. The first subgenus includes all examined species from the Old World (Africa, Europe, and Asia), except Eryngium tenue, E. viviparum, E. galioides, and E. corniculatum. Eryngium subgenus Monocotyloidea includes all examined species from the New World (North, Central and South America, and Australia; herein called the "New World sensu stricto" clade) plus the aforementioned Old World species that fall at the base of this clade. Most sectional and subgeneric divisions previously erected on the basis of morphology are not monophyletic. Within the "New World sensu stricto" group, six clades are well supported in analyses of plastid and combined plastid and nuclear data sets; the relationships among these clades, however, are unresolved. These clades are designated as "Mexican", "Eastern USA", "South American", "North American monocotyledonous", "South American monocotyledonous", and "Pacific". Members of each clade share similar geographical distributions and/or morphological or ecological traits. Evidence from branch lengths and low sequence divergence estimates suggests a rapid radiation at the base of each of these lineages. Conflict between chloroplast and nuclear data sets is weak, but the disagreements found are suggestive that hybrid speciation in Eryngium might have been a cause, but also a consequence, of the different rapid radiations observed. Dispersal-vicariance analysis indicates that Eryngium and its two subgenera originated from western Mediterranean ancestors and that the present-day distribution of the genus is explained by several dispersal events, including one trans-Atlantic dispersal. In general, these dispersals coincide with the polytomies observed, suggesting that they played key roles in the diversification of the genus. The evolution of Eryngium combines a history of long distance dispersals, rapid radiations, and hybridization, culminating in the taxonomic complexity observed today in the genus.},

The 23 characters examined include those of life history, vegetative morphology, inflorescences, and fruit morphology and anatomy. These characters were optimized over trees derived from maximum parsimony analysis of chloroplast DNA trnQ-trnK sequences from 94 accessions of Apiaceae. The results revealed that many of these characters have undergone considerable modification and that traditional assumptions regarding character-state polarity are often incorrect. Infrasubfamilial relationships inferred by molecular data are supported by one to five morphological characters. However, none of these morphological characters support the monophyly of subfamilies Saniculoideae or Apioideae, the clade of Petagnaea, Eryngium and Sanicula, or the sister-group relationship between Eryngium and Sanicula .

Ninety-one accessions representing 14 genera and 82 species of Apiaceae were examined, including the genera Steganotaenia, Polemanniopsis, and Lichtensteinia which have been traditionally treated in subfamily Apioideae but determined in recent studies to be more closely related to or included within subfamily Saniculoideae. The trnQ-trnK 5'-exon region includes two intergenic spacers heretofore underutilized in molecular systematic studies and the rps16 intron. Analyses of these loci permitted an assessment of the relative utility of these noncoding regions (including the use of indel characters) for phylogenetic study at different hierarchical levels. The use of indels in phylogenetic analyses of both combined and partitioned data sets improves resolution of relationships, increases bootstrap support values, and decreases levels of overall homoplasy. Intergeneric relationships derived from maximum parsimony, Bayesian, and maximum likelihood analyses, as well as from maximum parsimony analysis of indel data alone, are fully resolved and consistent with one another and generally very well supported. We confirm the expansion of subfamily Saniculoideae to include Steganotaenia and Polemanniopsis (as the new tribe Steganotaenieae C.I. Calviño and S.R. Downie) but not Lichtensteinia. Sister group to tribe Steganotaenieae is tribe Saniculeae, redefined to include the genera Actinolema, Alepidea, Arctopus, Astrantia, Eryngium, Petagnaea, and Sanicula. With the synonymization of Hacquetia into Sanicula, all genera are monophyletic.

Reiterative analyses examined data of both alleles using ambiguity codes or a single allele with the highest coverage, trimmed vs. untrimmed homopolymers; pure exonic vs. pure intronic data; the use of all 94 markers vs. a reduced subset of markers; and analysis of a concatenated data set vs. a coalescent (species tree) approach.• KEY RESULTS Our maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood trees were highly resolved, with 100\% bootstrap support for most of the external and many of the internal clades. They resolved multiple accessions of many different species as monophyletic with strong support, but failed to support other species. The single allele analysis gave slightly better topological resolution; trimming homopolymers failed to increase taxonomic resolution; the exonic data had a smaller proportion of parsimony-informative characters. Similar results demonstrating the same dominant topology can be obtained with many fewer markers. A Bayesian concordance analysis provided an overall similar phylogeny, but the coalescent analysis provided drastic changes in topology to all the above.• CONCLUSIONS Our research highlights some difficult species groups in Daucus and misidentifications in germplasm collections. It highlights a useful subset of markers and approaches for future studies of dominant topologies in Daucus.},

METHODS We evaluated character state distributions, stepwise discriminant analyses, canonical variate analyses, and hierarchical cluster analyses from 40 morphological characters from 81 accessions of 14 taxa of Daucus and eight species in related genera in an experimental plot. KEY RESULTS Most characters showed tremendous variation with character state overlap across many taxa. Multivariate analyses separated the outgroup taxa easily from the Daucus ingroup. Concordant with molecular analyses, most species form phenetic groups, except the same taxa that are problematical in the molecular results: (1) the subspecies of D. carota, (2) D. sahariensis and D. syrticus, and (3) D. broteri and D. guttatus. CONCLUSIONS Phenetic analyses, in combination with molecular data, support many Daucus species, but mostly by overlapping ranges of size and meristic variation. The subspecies of D. carota are poorly separated morphologically, are paraphyletic, and all could be recognized at the subspecies rank under D. carota. Daucus sahariensis and D. syrticus are so similar morphologically that they could be placed in synonymy. Combined molecular and morphological data support three species in accessions previously identified as D. broteri and D. guttatus.

Here we use DNA sequences of 1180 bp of two mitochondrial genes, 16S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit I, from 32 individuals from Middle East and North Africa, and Bayesian methods to derive a phylogeny for 11 species of Oenanthe. The resulting tree supported three major clades: (A) O. alboniger, O. chrysopygia, O. lugens, O. finschii, O. leucopyga, O. picata, O. moesta, (B) O. deserti and O. pleschanka; and (C) O. isabellina and O. oenanthe. These results largely differ from previous hypotheses based on analysis of morphological and chromatic characters. However, the two clades (B) and (C) were also supported by a phenetic analysis of new morphometric data presented here, indicating that characters related to colouration and ecology in Oenanthe are more strongly influenced by homoplasy than those of body shape.},

The resultant phylogeny clearly indicates that Goniothalamus is monophyletic. Preliminary research initially focused on identifying synapomorphies and estimating the phylogenetic signal of selected morphological characters based on parsimony and likelihood ancestral character state reconstructions. This prescreening of characters enabled 40 to be selected for further study, and of these 15 are shown here to demonstrate significant phylogenetic signal and to provide clear synapomorphies for several infrageneric clades. Although floral structure in Goniothalamus is comparatively uniform, suggesting a common basic pattern of pollination ecology, fruit and seed morphology in the genus is very diverse and is presumably associated with different patterns of frugivory. The present study assesses correlations amongst fruit and seed characters which are putatively of functional importance with regard to frugivory and dispersal. One-way phylogenetic ANOVA indicates significant phylogenetically independent correlation between the following fruit and seed characters: fruits borne on older branches and/or on the main trunk have larger monocarps than fruits borne on young branches; and monocarps that contain seeds with a hairy testa are larger than those with glabrous seeds. We discuss fruit morphologies and potential explanations for the inferred correlations, and suggest that they may be the result of adaptation to different frugivores (birds, larger non-volant animal and primate seed dispersers, respectively).},

Over 4000 nucleotides from 51 species (of the total 53) were sequenced. The five cpDNA datasets were analyzed separately and in combination using maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian methods. The phylogenetic trees constructed using all three phylogenetic methods, based on the combined data, strongly support the monophyly of Pseuduvaria following the inclusion of Craibella phuyensis. The trees generated using MP were less well resolved, but relationships are similar to those obtained using the other methods. ML and Bayesian analyses recovered trees with short branch lengths, showing five main clades. This study highlights the evolutionary changes in seven selected morphological characters (floral sex, stamen and carpel numbers, inner petal color, presence of inner petal glands, flowering peduncle length, and monocarp size). Although floral unisexuality is ancestral within the genus, several evolutionary lineages reveal reversal to bisexuality. Other phylogenetic transitions include the evolution of sapromyophily, and fruit-bat frugivory and seed dispersal, thus allowing a wide range of adaptations for species survival.},

	volume = {9},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-9-153},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND Phylogenetic analyses of the Annonaceae consistently identify four clades: a basal clade consisting of Anaxagorea, and a small 'ambavioid' clade that is sister to two main clades, the 'long branch clade' (LBC) and 'short branch clade' (SBC). Divergence times in the family have previously been estimated using non-parametric rate smoothing (NPRS) and penalized likelihood (PL). Here we use an uncorrelated lognormal (UCLD) relaxed molecular clock in BEAST to estimate diversification times of the main clades within the family with a focus on the Asian genus Pseuduvaria within the SBC. Two fossil calibration points are applied, including the first use of the recently discovered Annonaceae fossil Futabanthus. The taxonomy and morphology of Pseuduvaria have been well documented, although no previous dating or biogeographical studies have been undertaken. Ancestral areas at internal nodes within Pseuduvaria are determined using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) and weighted ancestral area analysis (WAAA). RESULTS The divergence times of the main clades within the Annonaceae were found to deviate slightly from previous estimates that used different calibration points and dating methods. In particular, our estimate for the SBC crown (55.2-26.9 Mya) is much younger than previous estimates (62.5-53.1 +/- 3.6 Mya and ca. 58.76 Mya). Early diversification of Pseuduvaria was estimated to have occurred 15-8 Mya, possibly associated with the 'mid-Miocene climatic optimum.' Pseuduvaria is inferred to have originated in Sundaland in the late Miocene, ca. 8 Mya; subsequent migration events were predominantly eastwards towards New Guinea and Australia, although several migratory reversals are also postulated. Speciation of Pseuduvaria within New Guinea may have occurred after ca. 6.5 Mya, possibly coinciding with the formation of the Central Range orogeny from ca. 8 Mya. CONCLUSION Our divergence time estimates within the Annonaceae are likely to be more precise as we used a UCLD clock model and calibrated the phylogeny using new fossil evidence. Pseuduvaria is shown to have dispersed from Sundaland after the late Miocene. The present-day paleotropical distribution of Pseuduvaria may have been achieved by long-distance dispersal, and speciation events might be explained by global climatic oscillations, sea level fluctuations, and tectonic activity.},

	abstract = {The plastid trnL-F region has proved useful in molecular phylogenetic studies addressing diverse evolutionary questions from biogeographic history to character evolution in a broad range of plant groups. An important assumption for phylogenetic reconstruction is that data used in combined analyses contain the same phylogenetic signal. The trnL-F region is often used in combined analyses of multiple chloroplast markers. These markers are assumed to contain congruent phylogenetic signal due to lack of recombination. Here we show that trnL-F sequences display a phylogenetic signal conflicting with that of other chloroplast markers in Annonaceae, and we demonstrate that this conflict results from ancient paralogy. TrnL-F copy 2 diverged from trnL-F copy 1 (as used in family-wide phylogenetic analyses) in a direct ancestor of the Annonaceae. Although this divergence dates back 88 million years or more, the exons of both copies appear to be intact. In this case, assuming that (putative) chloroplast markers contain the same phylogenetic signal results in an incorrect topology and an incorrect estimate of ages. Our study demonstrates that researchers should be cautious when interpreting gene phylogenies, irrespective of the genome from which they are presumed to have been sampled.},

The tremendous ecological and morphological diversity of this clade, including ramiflory, cauliflory, flagelliflory, and clonality, suggests adaptive radiation. Despite the spectacular phenotypic divergence of this clade, little is known about its phylogenetic and evolutionary history. In this study we used a nuclear DNA marker and seven chloroplast markers, and maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods to reconstruct a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny of tribe Miliuseae, especially focusing on the Desmopsis-Stenanona clade. We also perform ancestral area reconstructions to infer the biogeographic history of this group. Finally, we use ecological niche modeling, lineage distribution models, and niche overlap tests to assess whether geographic isolation and ecological specialization influenced the diversification of lineages within this clade. We reconstructed a monophyletic Miliuseae that is divided into two strongly supported clades: (i) a Sapranthus-Tridimeris clade and (ii) a Desmopsis-Stenanona clade. The colonization of the Neotropics and subsequent diversification of Neotropical Miliuseae seems to have been associated with the expansion of the boreotropical forests during the late Eocene and their subsequent fragmentation and southern displacement. Further speciation within Neotropical Miliuseae out of the Maya block seems to have occurred during the last 15 million years. Lastly, the geographic structuring of major lineages of the Desmopsis-Stenanona clade seems to have followed a climatic gradient, supporting the hypothesis that morphological differentiation between closely related species resulted from both long-term isolation between geographic ranges and adaptation to environmental conditions.},

A phylogenetic study to investigate the putative monophyly of the tribe and the intergeneric relationships is presented here. Nucleotide sequences of the plastid gene rbcL, trnL intron, and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer were analyzed from 114 Annonaceae taxa, including 24 Miliuseae species and two outgroups using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. The two data sets (rbcL and the trnL-trnF regions) were analyzed separately and in combination. Miliuseae were found to be polyphyletic due to the position of Mezzettia and are part of a large, predominantly Asian and Central-American clade (miliusoid clade). Although intergeneric relationships were poorly resolved, all genera, except Polyalthia, were monophyletic, supporting previous generic delimitation based on morphology. A group of three Polyalthia species seems the most likely sister group of Miliusa. Several infrageneric groups of Miliusa, Orophea, and Polyalthia are supported by both molecular and morphological data. No morphological synapomorphies have yet been found for the miliusoid clade. Molecular clades within the miliusoid clade, however, can be characterized by size and the shape of the outer petals, number of ovules per carpel, and the size of the fruits.},

Nevertheless, some woody and androdioecious plants have hermaphrodite ancestors, as in the Annonaceae, where androdioecious genera have arisen several times in different lineages. The majority of androdioecious species of Annonaceae belong to the Neotropical tribe Malmeeae. In addition to these species, Pseudoxandra spiritus-sancti was recently confirmed to be androdioecious. Here, we describe the morphology of male and bisexual flowers of Pseudoxandra spiritus-sancti, and investigate the evolution of androdioecy in Malmeeae. The phylogeny of tribe Malmeeae was reconstructed using Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood of 32 taxa, using DNA sequences of 66 molecular markers of the chloroplast genome, sequenced by next generation sequencing. The reconstruction of ancestral states was performed for characters associated with sexual systems and floral morphology. The phylogenetic analyses reconstructed three main groups in Malmeeae, (Malmea (Cremastosperma, Pseudoxandra)) sister to the rest of the tribe, and (Unonopsis (Bocageopsis, Onychopetalum)) sister to (Mosannona, Ephedranthus, Klarobelia, Oxandra, Pseudephedranthus fragrans, Pseudomalmea, Ruizodendron ovale). Hermaphroditism is plesiomorphic in the tribe, with four independent evolutions of androdieocy, which represents a synapomorphy of two groups, one that includes three genera and 14 species, the other with a single genus of seven species. Male flowers are unisexual from inception and bisexual flowers possess staminodes and functional stamens. Pseudoxandra spiritus-sancti is structurally androdioecious.},

We reconstruct the phylogeny of Disepalum and related taxa based on four chloroplast and two nuclear DNA regions as a framework for clarifying taxonomic delimitation and assessing evolutionary transitions in key morphological characters. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods resulted in a consistent, well-resolved and strongly supported topology. Disepalum s.l. is monophyletic and strongly supported, with Disepalum s.str. and Enicosanthellum retrieved as sister groups. Although this topology is consistent with both taxonomic delimitations, the distribution of morphological synapomorphies provides greater support for the inclusion of Enicosanthellum within Disepalum s.l. We propose a novel infrageneric classification with two subgenera. Subgen. Disepalum (= Disepalum s.str.) is supported by numerous synapomorphies, including the reduction of the calyx to two sepals and connation of petals. Subgen. Enicosanthellum lacks obvious morphological synapomorphies, but possesses several diagnostic characters (symplesiomorphies), including a trimerous calyx and free petals in two whorls. We evaluate changes in petal morphology in relation to hypotheses of the genetic control of floral development and suggest that the compression of two petal whorls into one and the associated fusion of contiguous petals may be associated with the loss of the pollination chamber, which in turn may be associated with a shift in primary pollinator. We also suggest that the formation of pollen octads may be selectively advantageous when pollinator visits are infrequent, although this would only be applicable if multiple ovules could be fertilized by each octad; since the flowers are apocarpous, this would require an extragynoecial compitum to enable intercarpellary growth of pollen tubes. We furthermore infer that the monocarp fruit stalks are likely to have evolved independently from those in other Annonaceae genera and may facilitate effective dispersal by providing a color contrast within the fruit.},

	abstract = {The molecular clock hypothesis is an important concept in biology. Deviations from a constant rate of nucleotide substitution have been found widely among lineages, genomes, genes and individual sites. Phylogenetic research can accommodate for these differences in applying specific models of evolution. Lineage-specific rate heterogeneity however can generate bi- or multimodal distributions of substitution rates across the branches of a tree and this may mislead phylogenetic inferences with currently available models. The plant family Annonaceae is an excellent case to study lineage-specific rate heterogeneity. The two major sister subfamilies, Annonoideae and Malmeoideae, have shown great discrepancies in branch lengths. We used high-throughput sequencing data of 72 genes, 99 spacers and 16 introns from 24 chloroplast genomes and nuclear ribosomal DNA of 23 species to study the molecular rate of evolution in Annonaceae. In all analyses, longer branch lengths and/or higher substitution rates were found for the Annonoideae compared to the Malmeoideae. The Annonaceae had wide variability in chloroplast length, ranging from minimal 175,684bp to 201,723 for Annonoideae and minimal 152,357 to 170,985bp in Malmeoideae, mostly reflecting variation in inverted-repeat length. The Annonoideae showed a higher GC-content in the conserved parts of the chloroplast genome and higher omega (dN/dS)-ratios than the Malmeoideae, which could indicate less stringent purifying selection, a pattern that has been found in groups with small population sizes. This study generates new insights into the processes causing lineage-specific rate heterogeneity, which could lead to improved phylogenetic methods.},

We address ancient intergeneric hybridisation in the early-divergent angiosperm family Annonaceae by phylogenetic reconstruction, divergence time estimation and coalescent simulation of the genus Dasymaschalon using a multi-locus approach based on molecular data from five chloroplast (matK, psbA-trnH, ndhF, rbcL, and trnL-F) and five nuclear (ITS, ETS, AP3, PhyA, and PhyC) DNA markers. We demonstrate incongruence among different gene trees: Dasymaschalon is retrieved as monophyletic in the nuclear ribosomal tree (based on ITS and ETS), but is non-monophyletic in the chloroplast and Phy-gene trees (with poor resolution in the AP3 tree), with the majority of species assigned to a strongly supported clade but three species (D. filipes, D. longiflorum and D. tibetense) more closely related to the sister genus Friesodielsia. Three contrasting approaches-a coalescent method based on molecular dating, incongruence pattern comparison, and a multi-accession phylogenetic reconstruction-are used to assess the patterns of this gene tree incongruence and test hypotheses of ancient hybridisation and incomplete lineage sorting. Our results support a late Miocene intergeneric hybridisation between members of the Dasymaschalon and Friesodielsia lineages in continental Asia-west Malesia.},

Previous molecular phylogenetic studies targeting different taxa have generated large quantities of partially overlapping DNA sequence data for many species, although a large-scale phylogeny based on the maximum number of representatives has never been reconstructed. We use a supermatrix of eight chloroplast markers (rbcL, matK, ndhF, psbA-trnH, trnL-F, atpB-rbcL, trnS-G and ycf1) to reconstruct the most comprehensive tree to date, including 705 species (29\%) from 105 genera (98\%). This provides novel insights into the relationships of five enigmatic genera (Bocagea, Boutiquea, Cardiopetalum, Duckeanthus and Phoenicanthus). Fifteen main clades are retrieved in subfamilies Annonoideae and Malmeoideae collectively, 14 of which correspond with currently recognised tribes. Phoenicanthus cannot be accommodated in any existing tribe, however: it is retrieved as sister to a clade comprising the tribes Dendrokingstonieae, Monocarpieae and Miliuseae, and we therefore validate a new tribe, Phoenicantheae. Our results provide strong support for many previously recognised groups, but also indicate non-monophyly of several genera (Desmopsis, Friesodielsia, Klarobelia, Oxandra, Piptostigma and Stenanona).

Guatteria (Annonaceae) is, with 265 species, the third largest genus of Neotropical trees after Inga (Fabaceae) and Ocotea (Lauraceae), and its widespread distribution and frequent occurrence makes the genus an excellent model taxon to study diversification patterns. This study reconstructed the phylogeny of Guatteria and inferred three major biogeographical events in the history of the genus: (1) a trans-oceanic Miocene migration from Central into South America before the closing of the Isthmus of Panama; (2) a major diversification of the lineage within South America; and (3) several migrations of South American lineages back into Central America via the closed Panamanian land bridge. Therefore, Guatteria is not an Amazonian centred-genus sensu Gentry but a major Miocene diversification that followed its dispersal into South America. This study provides further evidence that migration into the Neotropics was an important factor in the historical assembly of its biodiversity. Furthermore, it is shown that phylogenetic patterns are comparable to those found in Ocotea and Inga and that a closer comparison of these genera is desirable.},

	abstract = {The congenital fusion of carpels, or syncarpy, is considered a key innovation as it is found in more than 80\% of angiosperms. Within the magnoliids however, syncarpy has rarely evolved. Two alternative evolutionary origins of syncarpy were suggested in order to explain the evolution of this feature: multiplication of a single carpel vs. fusion of a moderate number of carpels. The magnoliid family Annonaceae provides an ideal situation to test these hypotheses as two African genera, Isolona and Monodora, are syncarpous in an otherwise apocarpous family with multicarpellate and unicarpellate genera. In addition to syncarpy, the evolution of six other morphological characters was studied. Well-supported phylogenetic relationships of African Annonaceae and in particular those of Isolona and Monodora were reconstructed. Six plastid regions were sequenced and analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. The Bayesian posterior mapping approach to study character evolution was used as it accounts for both mapping and phylogenetic uncertainty, and also allows multiple state changes along the branches. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered a fully resolved clade comprising twelve genera endemic to Africa, including Isolona and Monodora, which was nested within the so-called long-branch clade. This is the largest and most species-rich clade of African genera identified to date within Annonaceae. The two syncarpous genera were inferred with maximum support to be sister to a clade characterized by genera with multicarpellate apocarpous gynoecia, supporting the hypothesis that syncarpy arose by fusion of a moderate number of carpels. This hypothesis was also favoured when studying the floral anatomy of both genera. Annonaceae provide the only case of a clear evolution of syncarpy within an otherwise apocarpous magnoliid family. The results presented here offer a better understanding of the evolution of syncarpy in Annonaceae and within angiosperms in general.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Tribe Miliuseae (∼25 genera and ∼510 species) includes a substantial part of the species and generic diversity in the pantropical flowering-plant family Annonaceae (∼108 genera and ∼2400 species). Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses have failed to resolve the backbone phylogeny of the tribe, impeding biogeographical and evolutionary studies. We use a dense generic taxon sample (∼89\% of generic diversity in Miliuseae) and plastid DNA sequence data (∼7 kb) to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of and within the tribe. METHODS Parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions and ancestral character-state reconstructions of several reproductive characters were performed. KEY RESULTS Dendrokingstoniae, Monocarpieae, and Miliuseae are recovered in a strongly supported clade, and each tribe is strongly supported as monophyletic. Miliuseae are characterized by a synapomorphic cryptoaperturate/disulculate pollen apertural system. Stenanona is shown to be nested within the paraphyletic genus Desmopsis. The only Neotropical clade (Sapranthus, Tridimeris, Desmopsis, and Stenanona) in the predominantly Asian Miliuseae is shown to be closely related to an undescribed genus from continental Southeast Asia and the Indo-Malayan and Austral-Pacific genus Meiogyne. Ancestral character-state reconstructions of several reproductive characters that are diagnostically important at the generic level indicate a considerable degree of homoplasy. CONCLUSIONS The results improve our understanding of the relationships of and within Miliuseae, but parts of the backbone of the phylogeny remain poorly supported. Additional data from variable nuclear markers or reduced-genome-representation approaches seem to be required to further resolve relationships within this recalcitrant clade.},

Here we use a phylogeny based on six nuclear and plastid loci sequenced for 15 species representing the four genera to infer their relationships and the relative and absolute ages of the range disjunctions. Combretocarpus is sister to the other three genera, and Polygonanthus then sister to Poga and Anisophyllea. Ansiophyllea, represented by 12 species from all three continents, is monophyletic. A relaxed Bayesian clock calibrated with the oldest fossils from a relevant outgroup, Tetramelaceae, suggests that the disjunctions between Combretocarpus, Poga, and Polygonanthus date back to the Cretaceous, Mid-, and Upper Eocene, whereas the intercontinental disjunctions within Anisophyllea appear to date back only some 22-23 million years and thus probably result from long-distance dispersal.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-7-217},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND Rosids are a major clade in the angiosperms containing 13 orders and about one-third of angiosperm species. Recent molecular analyses recognized two major groups (i.e., fabids with seven orders and malvids with three orders). However, phylogenetic relationships within the two groups and among fabids, malvids, and potentially basal rosids including Geraniales, Myrtales, and Crossosomatales remain to be resolved with more data and a broader taxon sampling. In this study, we obtained DNA sequences of the mitochondrial matR gene from 174 species representing 72 families of putative rosids and examined phylogenetic relationships and phylogenetic utility of matR in rosids. We also inferred phylogenetic relationships within the "rosid clade" based on a combined data set of 91 taxa and four genes including matR, two plastid genes (rbcL, atpB), and one nuclear gene (18S rDNA). RESULTS Comparison of mitochondrial matR and two plastid genes (rbcL and atpB) showed that the synonymous substitution rate in matR was approximately four times slower than those of rbcL and atpB; however, the nonsynonymous substitution rate in matR was relatively high, close to its synonymous substitution rate, indicating that the matR has experienced a relaxed evolutionary history. Analyses of our matR sequences supported the monophyly of malvids and most orders of the rosids. However, fabids did not form a clade; instead, the COM clade of fabids (Celastrales, Oxalidales, Malpighiales, and Huaceae) was sister to malvids. Analyses of the four-gene data set suggested that Geraniales and Myrtales were successively sister to other rosids, and that Crossosomatales were sister to malvids. CONCLUSION Compared to plastid genes such as rbcL and atpB, slowly evolving matR produced less homoplasious but not less informative substitutions. Thus, matR appears useful in higher-level angiosperm phylogenetics. Analysis of matR alone identified a novel deep relationship within rosids, the grouping of the COM clade of fabids and malvids, which was not resolved by any previous molecular analyses but recently suggested by floral structural features. Our four-gene analysis supported the placements of Geraniales, Myrtales at basal nodes of the rosid clade and placed Crossosomatales as sister to malvids. We also suggest that the core part of rosids should include fabids, malvids and Crossosomatales.},

Previous phylogenetic studies of the rosids have primarily utilized organelle genes that likely differ in evolutionary histories from nuclear genes. To better understand the evolutionary history of rosids, it is necessary to investigate their phylogenetic relationships using nuclear genes. Here, we employed large-scale phylogenomic datasets composed of nuclear genes, including 891 clusters of putative orthologous genes. Combined with comprehensive taxon sampling covering 63 species representing 14 out of the 17 orders, we reconstructed the rosids phylogeny with coalescence and concatenation methods, yielding similar tree topologies from all datasets. However, these topologies did not agree on the placement of Zygophyllales. Through comprehensive analyses, we found that missing data and gene tree heterogeneity were potential factors that may mislead concatenation methods, in particular, large amounts of missing data under high gene tree heterogeneity. Our results provided new insights into the deep phylogenetic relationships of the rosids, and demonstrated that coalescence methods may effectively resolve the phylogenetic relationships of the rosids with missing data under high gene tree heterogeneity.},

To examine the evolution of plastome structure in early-diverging eudicots, we determined the complete plastome sequences of eight previously unsequenced early-diverging eudicot taxa, Pachysandra terminalis (Buxaceae), Meliosma aff. cuneifolia (Sabiaceae), Sabia yunnanensis (Sabiaceae), Epimedium sagittatum (Berberidaceae), Euptelea pleiosperma (Eupteleaceae), Akebia trifoliata (Lardizabalaceae), Stephania japonica (Menispermaceae) and Papaver somniferum (Papaveraceae), and compared them to previously published plastomes of the early-diverging eudicots Buxus, Tetracentron, Trochodendron, Nelumbo, Platanus, Nandina, Megaleranthis, Ranunculus, Mahonia and Macadamia. All of the newly sequenced plastomes share the same 79 protein-coding genes, 4 rRNA genes, and 30 tRNA genes, except for that of Epimedium, in which infA is pseudogenized and clpP is highly divergent and possibly a pseudogene. The boundaries of the plastid Inverted Repeat (IR) were found to vary significantly across early-diverging eudicots; IRs ranged from 24.3 to 36.4kb in length and contained from 18 to 33 genes. Based on gene content, the IR was classified into six types, with shifts among types characterized by high levels of homoplasy. Reconstruction of ancestral IR gene content suggested that 18 genes were likely present in the IR region of the ancestor of eudicots. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of a 79-gene, 97-taxon data set that included all available early-diverging eudicots and representative sampling of remaining angiosperm diversity largely agreed with previous estimates of early-diverging eudicot relationships, but resolved Trochodendrales rather than Buxales as sister to Gunneridae, albeit with relatively weak bootstrap support, conflicting with what has been found for these three clades in most previous analyses. In addition, Proteales was resolved as sister to Sabiaceae with the highest support (bootstrap {\textgreater}90\%) yet observed in plastome-scale phylogenetic analyses.},

The placement of the Celastrales-Oxalidales-Malpighiales (COM) clade within Rosidae remains one of the most confounding phylogenetic questions in angiosperms, with previous analyses placing it with either Fabidae or Malvidae. To elucidate the position of COM, we assembled multi-gene matrices of chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear sequences, as well as large single- and multi-copy nuclear gene data sets. Analyses of multi-gene data sets demonstrate conflict between the chloroplast and both nuclear and mitochondrial data sets, and the results are robust to various character-coding and data-exclusion treatments. Analyses of single- and multi-copy nuclear loci indicate that most loci support the placement of COM with Malvidae, fewer loci support COM with Fabidae, and almost no loci support COM outside a clade of Fabidae and Malvidae. Although incomplete lineage sorting and ancient introgressive hybridization remain as plausible explanations for the conflict among loci, more complete sampling is necessary to evaluate these hypotheses fully. Our results emphasize the importance of genomic data sets for revealing deep incongruence and complex patterns of evolution.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Recent analyses employing up to five genes have provided numerous insights into angiosperm phylogeny, but many relationships have remained unresolved or poorly supported. In the hope of improving our understanding of angiosperm phylogeny, we expanded sampling of taxa and genes beyond previous analyses. METHODS We conducted two primary analyses based on 640 species representing 330 families. The first included 25260 aligned base pairs (bp) from 17 genes (representing all three plant genomes, i.e., nucleus, plastid, and mitochondrion). The second included 19846 aligned bp from 13 genes (representing only the nucleus and plastid). KEY RESULTS Many important questions of deep-level relationships in the nonmonocot angiosperms have now been resolved with strong support. Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales are successive sisters to the remaining angiosperms (Mesangiospermae), which are resolved into Chloranthales + Magnoliidae as sister to Monocotyledoneae + [Ceratophyllaceae + Eudicotyledoneae]. Eudicotyledoneae contains a basal grade subtending Gunneridae. Within Gunneridae, Gunnerales are sister to the remainder (Pentapetalae), which comprises (1) Superrosidae, consisting of Rosidae (including Vitaceae) and Saxifragales; and (2) Superasteridae, comprising Berberidopsidales, Santalales, Caryophyllales, Asteridae, and, based on this study, Dilleniaceae (although other recent analyses disagree with this placement). Within the major subclades of Pentapetalae, most deep-level relationships are resolved with strong support. CONCLUSIONS Our analyses confirm that with large amounts of sequence data, most deep-level relationships within the angiosperms can be resolved. We anticipate that this well-resolved angiosperm tree will be of broad utility for many areas of biology, including physiology, ecology, paleobiology, and genomics.},

	abstract = {Two, apparently functional, paralogues of the RPB2 gene, which encodes the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, are shown to be present in two major groups of asterid plants. Although all other land plants surveyed so far have been found to have only one of these two copies, the RPB2 gene phylogeny inferred from the 3' half of the gene for 35 angiosperm taxa and six other land plants indicates that the duplication of the RPB2 gene occurred earlier than the time for origin of the asterid group, probably near the origin of "core eudicots." The d copy is present in all plants which are unambiguously assigned to the core eudicots, whereas the I copy is retained only in the lamiid clade, Ericales, and Escallonia, all belonging to the asterid group of plants. Both parsimony and likelihood analyses of sequences from the 3' half of the gene give strong bootstrap support for these conclusions. There is no support for monophyly of the taxa having both copies. Thus, numerous losses of one of the copies must be inferred. Structurally, both paralogues appear functional, and transcription is demonstrated for both copies. In the lamiid group, the d copy has lost introns 18-23. The well supported phylogenetic relationships implied by the RPB2 gene phylogeny are largely congruent with well supported phylogenetic hypotheses based on other sequence data. However, Ilex, usually assigned to the campanuliid clade, is instead supported as being a member of the lamiid clade, both from sequence data and the presence of an I copy as well as the loss of introns 18-23 in the d copy. Escallonia, supported as a member of the campanuliid clade both by RPB2-d-sequences and previously published DNA sequence data, has all the introns 18-23 in its d copy, as do all other members studied from the campanuliid group. We used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach of the MrBayes program to implement Maximum Likelihood bootstrapping. Under the same model of evolution, bootstrapping frequencies are significantly lower than the Bayesian posterior probabilities inferred from the MCMC chain.},

This group consists of about 10,000 species assigned to 20 families and four orders, Canellales, Piperales, Laurales, and Magnoliales. Some relationships among the families are still largely debated. Here, we reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of Magnoliidae as a whole, sampling 199 species (representing ca. 75\% of genera) and 12 molecular markers from the three genomes (plastid atpB, matK, trnL intron, trnL-trnF spacer, ndhF, rbcL; mitochondrial atp1, matR, mtSSU, mtLSU; nuclear 18s rDNA, 26S rDNA). Maximum likelihood, Bayesian and maximum parsimony analyses yielded congruent trees, with good resolution and high support values for higher-level relationships. This study further confirms, with greater levels of support, two major clades in Magnoliidae: Canellales+Piperales and Laurales+Magnoliales. Relationships among the 20 families are, in general, well resolved and supported. Several previously ambiguous relationships are now well supported. For instance, the Aristolochiaceae s.l. (incl. Asaroideae, Aristolochioideae, and Lactoris) are monophyletic with high support when Hydnoraceae are excluded. The latter family was not included in most previous studies because of the lack of suitable plastid sequences, a consequence of the parasitic habit of its species. Here, we confirm that it belongs in Aristolochiaceae. Our analyses also provide moderate support for a sister group relationship between Lauraceae and Monimiaceae. Conversely, the exact position of Magnoliaceae remains very difficult to determine. This study provides a robust phylogenetic background to address the evolutionary history of an important and highly diverse clade of early-diverging angiosperms.},

	abstract = {Long branches are potentially problematic in molecular dating because they can encompass a vast number of combinations of substitution rate and time. A long branch is suspected to have biased molecular clock estimates of the age of flowering plants (angiosperms) to be much older than their earliest fossils. This study explores the effect of the long branch subtending angiosperms in molecular dating and how different relaxed clocks react to it. Fossil angiosperm relatives, identified through a combined morphological and molecular phylogenetic analysis for living and fossil seed plants, were used to break the long angiosperm stem branch. Nucleotide sequences of angiosperm fossil relatives were simulated using a phylogeny and model parameters from living taxa and incorporated in molecular dating. Three relaxed clocks, which implement among-lineage rate heterogeneity differently, were used: penalized likelihood (using 2 different rate smoothing optimization criteria), a Bayesian rate-autocorrelated method, and a Bayesian uncorrelated method. Different clocks provided highly correlated ages across the tree. Breaking the angiosperm stem branch did not result in major age differences, except for a few sensitive nodes. Breaking the angiosperm stem branch resulted in a substantially younger age for crown angiosperms only with 1 of the 4 methods, but, nevertheless, the obtained age is considerably older than the oldest angiosperm fossils. The origin of crown angiosperms is estimated between the Upper Triassic and the early Permian. The difficulty in estimating crown angiosperm age probably lies in a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic complicating factors, including substantial molecular rate heterogeneity among lineages and through time. A more adequate molecular dating approach might combine moderate background rate heterogeneity with large changes in rate at particular points in the tree.},

To clarify relationships among these early-diverging eudicot lineages, we added entire sequences of 26S rDNA to the existing three-gene data set. In the combined analyses of four genes based on parsimony, ML, and Bayesian analysis, Ranunculales are strongly supported as a clade and are sister to other eudicots. Proteales appear as sister to the remaining eudicots, which are weakly (59\%) supported as a clade. Relationships among Trochodendraceae, Buxaceae (including Didymeles), Sabiaceae, and Proteales remain unclear. Within Ranunculales, Eupteleaceae are sister to all other Ranunculales, with bootstrap support of 70\% in parsimony analysis and with posterior probability of 1.00 in Bayesian analysis. Our character reconstructions indicate that the woody habit is ancestral, not only for the basal angiosperms, but also for the eudicots. Furthermore, Ranunculales may not be ancestrally herbaceous, as long maintained. The woody habit appears to have been ancestral for several major clades of eudicots, including Caryophyllales, and asterids.},

For the most part, the organization of these plastid genomes is quite similar to the ancestral angiosperm plastid genome with a few notable exceptions. Dioscorea has lost one protein-coding gene, rps16; this gene loss has also happened independently in four other land plant lineages, liverworts, conifers, Populus, and legumes. There has also been a small expansion of the inverted repeat (IR) in Dioscorea that has duplicated trnH-GUG. This event has also occurred multiple times in angiosperms, including in monocots, and in the two basal angiosperms Nuphar and Drimys. The Illicium chloroplast genome is unusual by having a 10 kb contraction of the IR. The four taxa sequenced represent key groups in resolving phylogenetic relationships among angiosperms. Illicium is one of the basal angiosperms in the Austrobaileyales, Chloranthus (Chloranthales) remains unplaced in angiosperm classifications, and Buxus and Dioscorea are early-diverging eudicots and monocots, respectively. We have used sequences for 61 shared protein-coding genes from these four genomes and combined them with sequences from 35 other genomes to estimate phylogenetic relationships using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian methods. There is strong congruence among the trees generated by the three methods, and most nodes have high levels of support. The results indicate that Amborella alone is sister to the remaining angiosperms; the Nymphaeales represent the next-diverging clade followed by Illicium; Chloranthus is sister to the magnoliids and together this group is sister to a large clade that includes eudicots and monocots; and Dioscorea represents an early-diverging lineage of monocots just internal to Acorus.},

The problem is known to be difficult due to the large genetic distance separating flowering plants from other seed plants and the sparse taxon sampling among basal angiosperms.

We show that support for Amborella as the sole representative of the most basal angiosperm lineage is founded on sequence site patterns poorly described by time-reversible substitution models. Improving the fit between sequence data and substitution model identifies Trithuria, Nymphaeaceae, and Amborella as surviving relatives of the most basal lineage of flowering plants.

Applying various tests of diversification that take into account topology, branch length, numbers of extant species as well as extinction, we evaluated diversification rates through time. We also compared these diversification profiles against the distribution of the climate modes of the Phanerozoic. RESULTS We found evidence for the radiations of ferns and mosses in the shadow of angiosperms coinciding with the rather warm Cretaceous global climate. In contrast, gymnosperms and liverworts show a signature of declining diversification rates during geological time periods of cool global climate. CONCLUSIONS This broad-scale phylogenetic analysis helps to reveal the successive waves of diversification that made up the diversity of land plants we see today. Both warm temperatures and wet climate may have been necessary for the rise of the diversity under a successive lineage replacement scenario.},

	volume = {63},
	doi = {10.1093/sysbio/syt108},
	abstract = {Since the advent of molecular phylogenetics more than 25 years ago, a major goal of plant systematists has been to discern the root of the angiosperms. Although most studies indicate that Amborella trichopoda is sister to all remaining extant flowering plants, support for this position has varied with respect to both the sequence data sets and analyses employed. Recently, Goremykin et al. (2013) questioned the "Amborella-sister hypothesis" using a "noise-reduction" approach and reported a topology with Amborella + Nymphaeales (water lilies) sister to all remaining angiosperms. Through a series of analyses of both plastid genomes and mitochondrial genes, we continue to find mostly strong support for the Amborella-sister hypothesis and offer a rebuttal of Goremykin et al. (2013). The major tenet of Goremykin et al. is that the Amborella-sister position is determined by noisy data--that is, characters with high rates of change and lacking true phylogenetic signal. To investigate the signal in these noisy data further, we analyzed the discarded characters from their noise-reduced alignments. We recovered a tree identical to that of the currently accepted angiosperm framework, including the position of Amborella as sister to all other angiosperms, as well as all other major clades. Thus, the signal in the "noisy" data is consistent with that of our complete data sets--arguing against the use of their noise-reduction approach. We also determined that one of the alignments presented by Goremykin et al. yields results at odds with their central claim--their data set actually supports Amborella as sister to all other angiosperms, as do larger plastid data sets we present here that possess more complete taxon sampling both within the monocots and for angiosperms in general. Previous unpartitioned, multilocus analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data have provided the strongest support for Amborella + Nymphaeales as sister to other angiosperms. However, our analysis of third codon positions from mtDNA sequence data also supports the Amborella-sister hypothesis. Finally, we challenge the conclusion of Goremykin et al. that the first flowering plants were aquatic and herbaceous, reasserting that even if Amborella + water lilies, or water lilies alone, are sister to the rest of the angiosperms, the earliest angiosperms were not necessarily aquatic and/or herbaceous.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The magnoliids with four orders, 19 families, and 8,500 species represent one of the largest clades of early diverging angiosperms. Although several recent angiosperm phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of magnoliids and suggested relationships among the orders, the limited number of genes examined resulted in only weak support, and these issues remain controversial. Furthermore, considerable incongruence resulted in phylogenetic reconstructions supporting three different sets of relationships among magnoliids and the two large angiosperm clades, monocots and eudicots. We sequenced the plastid genomes of three magnoliids, Drimys (Canellales), Liriodendron (Magnoliales), and Piper (Piperales), and used these data in combination with 32 other angiosperm plastid genomes to assess phylogenetic relationships among magnoliids and to examine patterns of variation of GC content. RESULTS The Drimys, Liriodendron, and Piper plastid genomes are very similar in size at 160,604, 159,886 bp, and 160,624 bp, respectively. Gene content and order are nearly identical to many other unrearranged angiosperm plastid genomes, including Calycanthus, the other published magnoliid genome. Overall GC content ranges from 34-39\%, and coding regions have a substantially higher GC content than non-coding regions. Among protein-coding genes, GC content varies by codon position with 1st codon {\textgreater} 2nd codon {\textgreater} 3rd codon, and it varies by functional group with photosynthetic genes having the highest percentage and NADH genes the lowest. Phylogenetic analyses using parsimony and likelihood methods and sequences of 61 protein-coding genes provided strong support for the monophyly of magnoliids and two strongly supported groups were identified, the Canellales/Piperales and the Laurales/Magnoliales. Strong support is reported for monocots and eudicots as sister clades with magnoliids diverging before the monocot-eudicot split. The trees also provided moderate or strong support for the position of Amborella as sister to a clade including all other angiosperms. CONCLUSION Evolutionary comparisons of three new magnoliid plastid genome sequences, combined with other published angiosperm genomes, confirm that GC content is unevenly distributed across the genome by location, codon position, and functional group. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses provide the strongest support so far for the hypothesis that the magnoliids are sister to a large clade that includes both monocots and eudicots.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses using genome-scale data sets must confront incongruence among gene trees, which in plants is exacerbated by frequent gene duplications and losses. Gene tree parsimony (GTP) is a phylogenetic optimization criterion in which a species tree that minimizes the number of gene duplications induced among a set of gene trees is selected. The run time performance of previous implementations has limited its use on large-scale data sets. We used new software that incorporates recent algorithmic advances to examine the performance of GTP on a plant data set consisting of 18,896 gene trees containing 510,922 protein sequences from 136 plant taxa (giving a combined alignment length of {\textgreater}2.9 million characters). The relationships inferred from the GTP analysis were largely consistent with previous large-scale studies of backbone plant phylogeny and resolved some controversial nodes. The placement of taxa that were present in few gene trees generally varied the most among GTP bootstrap replicates. Excluding these taxa either before or after the GTP analysis revealed high levels of phylogenetic support across plants. The analyses supported magnoliids sister to a eudicot + monocot clade and did not support the eurosid I and II clades. This study presents a nuclear genomic perspective on the broad-scale phylogenic relationships among plants, and it demonstrates that nuclear genes with a history of duplication and loss can be phylogenetically informative for resolving the plant tree of life.},

Given recent methodological improvements in estimating divergence times, refined understanding of relationships among major angiosperm lineages, and the immense interest in using large angiosperm phylogenies to investigate questions in ecology and comparative biology, new estimates of the ages of the major clades are badly needed. Improved estimations of divergence times will concomitantly improve our understanding of both the evolutionary history of the angiosperms and the patterns and processes that have led to this highly diverse clade. • METHODS We simultaneously estimated the age of the angiosperms and the divergence times of key angiosperm lineages, using 36 calibration points for 567 taxa and a "relaxed clock" methodology that does not assume any correlation between rates, thus allowing for lineage-specific rate heterogeneity. • KEY RESULTS Based on the analysis for which we set fossils to fit lognormal priors, we obtained an estimated age of the angiosperms of 167-199 Ma and the following age estimates for major angiosperm clades: Mesangiospermae (139-156 Ma); Gunneridae (109-139 Ma); Rosidae (108-121 Ma); Asteridae (101-119 Ma). • CONCLUSIONS With the exception of the age of the angiosperms themselves, these age estimates are generally younger than other recent molecular estimates and very close to dates inferred from the fossil record. We also provide dates for all major angiosperm clades (including 45 orders and 335 families [208 stem group age only, 127 both stem and crown group ages], sensu APG III). Our analyses provide a new comprehensive source of reference dates for major angiosperm clades that we hope will be of broad utility.},

Studies to date have often concluded that these groups are too young to have been influenced by these ancient continental movements. Here we examine a much larger and older angiosperm clade, the Campanulidae, and infer its biogeographic history by combining Bayesian divergence time information with a likelihood-based biogeographic model focused on the Gondwanan landmasses. RESULTS Our analyses imply that campanulids likely originated in the middle Albian ({\textasciitilde}105 Ma), and that a substantial portion of the early evolutionary history of campanulids took place in the Southern Hemisphere, despite their greater species richness in the Northern Hemisphere today. We also discovered several disjunctions that show biogeographic and temporal correspondence with the break-up of Gondwana. CONCLUSIONS While it is possible to discern traces of the break-up of Gondwana in clades that are old enough, it will generally be difficult to be confident in continental movement as the prime cause of geographic disjunctions. This follows from the need for the geographic disjunction, the inferred biogeographic scenario, and the dating of the lineage splitting events to be consistent with the causal hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Sequences of internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA, the chloroplast ndhF gene, and chloroplast trnL-F regions (trnL intron, and trnL [UAA] 3' exon-trnF [GAA] intergenic spacer) were used for phylogenetic analyses of Rhus, a genus disjunctly distributed in Asia, Europe, Hawaii, North America, and Northern Central America. Both ITS and cpDNA data sets support the monophyly of Rhus. The monophyly of subgenus Rhus was suggested by the combined cpDNA and ITS data, and largely supported in the cpDNA data except that Rhus microphylla of subgenus Lobadium was nested within it. The monophyly of subgenus Lobadium was strongly supported in the ITS data, whereas the cpDNA data revealed two main clades within the subgenus, which formed a trichotomy with the clade of subgenus Rhus plus R. microphylla. The ITS and cpDNA trees differ in the positions of Rhus michauxii, R. microphylla, and Rhus rubifolia, and hybridization may have caused this discordance. Fossil evidence indicates that Rhus dates back to the early Eocene. The penalized likelihood method was used to estimate divergence times, with fossils of Rhus subgenus Lobadium, Pistacia and Toxicodendron used for age constraints. Rhus diverged from its closest relative at 49.1+/-2.1 million years ago (Ma), the split of subgenus Lobadium and subgenus Rhus was at 38.1+/-3.0 Ma. Rhus most likely migrated from North America into Asia via the Bering Land Bridge during the Late Eocene (33.8+/-3.1 Ma). Rhus coriaria from southern Europe and western Asia diverged from its relatives in eastern Asia at 24.4+/-3.2 Ma. The Hawaiian Rhus sandwicensis diverged from the Asian Rhus chinensis at 13.5+/-3.0 Ma. Subgenus Lobadium was inferred to be of North American origin. Taxa of subgenus Lobadium then migrated southward to Central America. Furthermore, we herein make the following three nomenclatural combinations: (1) Searsia leptodictya (Diels) T. S. Yi, A. J. Miller and J. Wen, comb. nov., (2) Searsia pyroides (A. Rich.) T. S. Yi, A. J. Miller and J. Wen, comb. nov., and (3) Searsia undulata (Jacq.) T. S. Yi, A. J. Miller and J.

	abstract = {Pistacia L. exhibits a disjunct distribution in Mediterranean Eurasia and adjacent North Africa, eastern Asia, and North to Central America. The spatio-temporal diversification history of Pistacia was assessed to test hypotheses on the Madrean-Tethyan and the Eurasian Tethyan disjunctions through phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods were employed to analyze sequences of multiple nuclear and plastid loci of Pistacia species. Bayesian dating analysis was conducted to estimate the divergence times of clades. The likelihood method LAGRANGE was used to infer ancestral areas. The New World species of Pistacia formed a clade sister to the Old World clade in all phylogenetic analyses. The eastern Asian Pistacia weinmannifolia-P. cucphuongensis clade was sister to a clade of the remaining Old World species, which were further resolved into three subclades. Pistacia was estimated to have originated at 37.60 mya (with 95\% highest posterior density interval (HPD): 25.42-48.51 mya). A vicariance event in the early Miocene (19.79 mya with 95\% HPD: 10.88-30.36 mya) was inferred to account for the intercontinental disjunction between the New World and the Old World species, which is consistent with the Madrean-Tethyan hypothesis. The two Old World eastern Asian-Tethyan disjunctions are best explained by one vicariance event in the early Miocene (15.87 mya with 95\% HPD: 8.36-24.36 mya) and one dispersal event in late Miocene (5.89 mya with 95\% HPD: 2.68-9.16 mya). The diversification of the Old World Pistacia species was significantly affected by extensive geological and climatic changes in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP) and in the Mediterranean region.},

	abstract = {Recent molecular and morphological systematic investigations revealed that the cacti are most closely related to Anacampseroteae, Portulaca and Talinum of the family Portulacaceae (ACPT clade of suborder Portulacineae). A combined analysis of ndhF, matK, and nad1 sequence data from the chloroplast and the mitochondrial genomes indicates that the tribe Anacampseroteae is the sister group of the family Cactaceae. This clade, together with Portulaca, is well characterized by the presence of axillary hairs or scales. Relationships within Anacampseroteae are characterized by a grade of five species of Grahamia s.l. from North and South America, and Grahamia australiana is found to be sister to the genera Anacampseros and Avonia. A comparison of vegetative characteristics indicates an evolutionary transition from woody subshrubs to dwarf perennial and highly succulent herbs during the diversification of Anacampseroteae. Available evidence from the present investigation as well as from previously published studies suggests that a revised classification of Portulacineae on the basis of inferred phylogenetic relationships might consist of a superfamily that includes Cactaceae and the three genera Anacampseros s.l. (including Avonia and Grahamia s.l.), Portulaca, and Talinum (including Talinella), either referred to three monogeneric families or to a paraphyletic family Portulacaceae*.},

	volume = {59},
	doi = {10.1093/jxb/ern081},
	abstract = {The Portulacaceae is one of the few terrestrial plant families known to have both C(4) and Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) species. There may be multiple origins of the evolution of CAM within the Portulacaceae but the only clear evidence of C(4) photosynthesis is found in members of the genus Portulaca. In the Portulaca, CAM succulent tissue is overlaid with the C(4) tissue in a unique fashion where both pathways are operating simultaneously. Earlier reports have shown that the clade containing the genera Anacampseros and Grahamia may also contain C(4) photosynthetic species similar to the Portulaca, which would indicate multiple origins of C(4) photosynthesis within the family. The aim of the present study was to ascertain the true photosynthetic nature of these genera. An initial survey of the carbon isotope composition of the Anacampseros ranged from -12.6 per thousand to -24.0 per thousand, indicating very little CAM activity in some species, with other values close to the C(4) range. Anacampseros (=Grahamia) australiana which had been previously identified as a C(4) species had a carbon isotope composition value of -24.0 per thousand, which is more indicative of a C(3) species with a slight contribution of CAM activity. Other Anacampseros species with C(4)-like values have been shown to be CAM plants. The initial isotope analysis of the Grahamia species gave values in the range of -27.1 per thousand to -23.6 per thousand, placing the Grahamia species well towards the C(3) photosynthetic range. Further physiological studies indicated increased night-time CO(2) uptake with imposition of water stress, associated with a large diurnal acid fluctuation and a marked increased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity. This showed that the Grahamia species are actually facultative CAM plants despite their C(3)-like carbon isotope values. The results indicate that the Grahamia and Anacampseros species do not utilize the C(4) photosynthetic pathway. This is the first to identify that the Grahamia species are facultative CAM plants where CAM can be induced by water stress. This work supports earlier physiological work that indicates that this clade containing Anacampseros and Grahamia species comprises predominantly facultative CAM plants. This report suggests there may be only one clade which contains C(4) photosynthetic members with CAM-like characteristics.},

	abstract = {Snowdrops (Galanthus, 20 spp.; Amaryllidaceae) are cherished garden plants and the world's most traded wild-sourced ornamental bulb genus. Despite their popularity and economic importance, species delimitation is problematic and the infrageneric classification uncertain. We present a molecular phylogenetic study of Galanthus with the aim of resolving these issues and to better understand the evolution within the genus. Sequences of nuclear encoded nrITS, and plastid encoded matK, trnLF, ndhF, and psbK-psbI, for all currently recognised species and two naturally occurring putative hybrids, were analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Phylogenetic analysis of Galanthus, based on nuclear ITS sequences, provides a well-resolved topology, including seven well-supported named clades (platyphyllus, trojanus, ikariae, elwesii, nivalis, woronowii, and alpinus), and five major clades (A-E). The recovered ITS topology is in accordance with the geographical distribution of Galanthus species. The combined plastid data set provided far less resolution than that of ITS, with generally lower levels of statistical support, and one case of significant incongruence with the ITS dataset (involving G. gracilis). Phylogenetic network and hybridization analyses identified several possible hybridization events but these are more likely to be due to the result of a lack of resolution in the plastid dataset. The putative natural hybrid, G. ×valentinei nothosubsp. subplicatus, is supported by our data and analyses, whereas a hybrid origin for G. ×allenii is not. ITS and plastid data indicated that some Galanthus species are in need of taxonomic recircumscription.},

	abstract = {We investigated the origin of stylar polymorphisms in Narcissus, which possesses a remarkable range of stylar conditions and diverse types of floral morphology and pollination biology. Reconstruction of evolutionary change was complicated by incomplete resolution of trees inferred from two rapidly evolving chloroplast regions, but we bracketed reconstructions expected on the fully resolved plastid-based tree by considering all possible resolutions of polytomies on the shortest trees. Stigma-height dimorphism likely arose on several occasions in Narcissus and persisted across multiple speciation events. As proposed in published models, this rare type of stylar polymorphism is ancestral to distyly. While there is no evidence in Narcissus that dimorphism preceded tristyly, a rapid transition between them may explain the lack of a phylogenetic footprint for this evolutionary sequence. The single instances of distyly and tristyly in Narcissus albimarginatus and N. triandrus, respectively, are clearly not homologous, an evolutionary convergence unique to Amaryllidaceae. Floral morphology was likely an important trigger for the evolution of stylar polymorphisms: Concentrated-changes tests indicate that a long, narrow floral tube may have been associated with the emergence of stigma-height dimorphism and that this type of tube, in combination with a deep corona, likely promoted, or at least was associated with, the parallel origins of heterostyly.},

Taxonomic confusion exists among these closely related taxa. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and double-primer fluorescent intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) were employed to reexamine the taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships of grain amaranths and their wild relatives. Low ITS divergence in these taxa resulted in poorly resolved phylogeny. However, extensive polymorphisms exist at AFLP and ISSR loci both within and among species. In phylogenetic trees based on either AFLP or ISSR or the combined data sets, nearly all intraspecific accessions can be placed in their corresponding species clades, indicating that these taxa are well-separated species. The AFLP trees share many features in common with the ISSR trees, both showing a close relationship between A. caudatus and A. quitensis, placing A. hybridus in the same clade as all grain amaranths, and indicating that A. powellii is the most divergent taxon in the A. hybridus species complex. This study has demonstrated that both AFLP and double-primer fluorescent ISSR have a great potential for generating a large number of informative characters for phylogenetic analysis of closely related species, especially when ITS diversity is insufficient.},

	abstract = {The genus Amaranthus consists of 50-70 species and harbors several cultivated and weedy species of great economic importance. A small number of suitable traits, phenotypic plasticity, gene flow and hybridization made it difficult to establish the taxonomy and phylogeny of the whole genus despite various studies using molecular markers. We inferred the phylogeny of the Amaranthus genus using genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of 94 genebank accessions representing 35 Amaranthus species and measured their genome sizes. SNPs were called by de novo and reference-based methods, for which we used the distant sugarbeet Beta vulgaris and the closely related Amaranthus hypochondriacus as references. SNP counts and proportions of missing data differed between methods, but the resulting phylogenetic trees were highly similar. A distance-based neighbor joining tree of individual accessions and a species tree calculated with the multispecies coalescent supported a previous taxonomic classification into three subgenera although the subgenus A. Acnida consists of two highly differentiated clades. The analysis of the Hybridus complex within the A. Amaranthus subgenus revealed insights on the history of cultivated grain amaranths. The complex includes the three cultivated grain amaranths and their wild relatives and was well separated from other species in the subgenus. Wild and cultivated amaranth accessions did not differentiate according to the species assignment but clustered by their geographic origin from South and Central America. Different geographically separated populations of Amaranthus hybridus appear to be the common ancestors of the three cultivated grain species and A. quitensis might be additionally be involved in the evolution of South American grain amaranth (A. caudatus). We also measured genome sizes of the species and observed little variation with the exception of two lineages that showed evidence for a recent polyploidization. With the exception of two lineages, genome sizes are quite similar and indicate that polyploidization did not play a major role in the history of the genus.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Sarcocornia comprises about 28 species of perennial succulent halophytes distributed worldwide, mainly in saline environments of warm-temperate and subtropical regions. The genus is characterized by strongly reduced leaves and flowers, which cause taxonomic difficulties; however, species in the genus show high diversity in growth form, with a mat-forming habit found in coastal salt marshes of all continents. Sarcocornia forms a monophyletic lineage with Salicornia whose species are all annual, yet the relationship between the two genera is poorly understood. This study is aimed at clarifying the phylogenetic relationship between Sarcocornia and Salicornia, interpreting biogeographical and ecological patterns in Sarcocornia, and gaining insights into putative parallel evolution of habit as an adaptation to environmental factors. METHODS A comprehensively sampled and dated phylogeny of Sarcocornia is presented based on nuclear ribosomal DNA (external transcribed spacer) and chloroplast DNA (atpB-rbcL, rpl32-trnL) sequences; representative samples of Salicornia were also included in the analyses. To infer biogeographical patterns, an ancestral area reconstruction was conducted. KEY RESULTS The Sarcocornia/Salicornia lineage arose during the Mid-Miocene from Eurasian ancestors and diversified into four subclades: the Salicornia clade, the American Sarcocornia clade, the Eurasian Sarcocornia clade and the South African/Australian Sarcocornia clade. Sarcocornia is supported as paraphyletic, with Salicornia nested within Sarcocornia being sister to the American/Eurasian Sarcocornia clade. The American and the South African/Australian Sarcocornia clade as well as the Salicornia clade were reconstructed to be of Eurasian origin. The prostrate, mat-forming habit arose multiple times in Sarcocornia. CONCLUSIONS Sarcocornia diversified in salt-laden environments worldwide, repeatedly evolving superficially similar prostrate, mat-forming habits that seem advantageous in stressed environments with prolonged flooding, high tidal movement and frost. Some of these prostrate-habit types might be considered as ecotypes (e.g. S. pacifica or S. pillansii) while others represent good ecospecies (e.g. S. perennis, S. decumbens, S. capensis), hence representing different stages of speciation.},

	abstract = {The Western Mediterranean Region and Macaronesian Islands are one of the top biodiversity hotspots of Europe, containing a significant native genetic diversity of global value among the Crop Wild Relatives (CWR). Sugar beet is the primary crop of the genus Beta (subfamily Betoideae, Amaranthaceae) and despite the great economic importance of this genus, and of the close relative Patellifolia species, a reconstruction of their evolutionary history is still lacking. We analyzed nrDNA (ITS) and cpDNA gene (matK, trnH-psbA, trnL intron, rbcL) sequences to: (i) investigate the phylogenetic relationships within the Betoideae subfamily, and (ii) elucidate the historical biogeography of wild beet species in the Western Mediterranean Region, including the Macaronesian Islands. The results support the Betoideae as a monophyletic group (excluding the Acroglochin genus) and provide a detailed inference of relationships within this subfamily, revealing: (i) a deep genetic differentiation between Beta and Patellifolia species, which may have occurred in Late Oligocene; and (ii) the occurrence of a West-East genetic divergence within Beta, indicating that the Mediterranean species probably differentiated by the end of the Miocene. This was interpreted as a signature of species radiation induced by dramatic habitat changes during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC, 5.96-5.33 Mya). Moreover, colonization events during the Pleistocene also played a role in shaping the current diversity patterns among and within the Macaronesian Islands. The origin and number of these events could not be revealed due to insufficient phylogenetic resolution, suggesting that the diversification was quite recent in these archipelagos, and unravelling potential complex biogeographic patterns with hybridization and gene flow playing an important role. Finally, three evolutionary lineages were identified corresponding to major gene pools of sugar beet wild relatives, which provide useful information for establishing in situ and ex situ conservation priorities in the hotspot area of the Macaronesian Islands.},

Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences of four plastid regions, nrITS and nuclear 5S rDNA spacer region (NTS) of two tetraploid chenopods (2n=4x=36), Andean C. quinoa and North American C. berlandieri, and their diploid relatives allowed inferences of their origin. The phylogenetic analyses confirmed allotetraploid origin of both tetraploids involving diploids of two different genomic groups (genomes A and B) and suggested that these two might share very similar parentage. The hypotheses on the origin of the two allopolyploid species were further tested using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). Several diploid Chenopodium species belonging to the two lineages, genome A and B, suggested by phylogenetic analyses, were tested as putative parental taxa. GISH differentiated two sets of parental chromosomes in both tetraploids and further corroborated their allotetraploid origin. Putative diploid parental taxa have been suggested by GISH for C. quinoa and C. berlandieri. Genome sizes of the analyzed allotetraploids fit nearly perfectly the expected additive values of the putative parental taxa. Directional and uniparental loss of rDNA loci of the maternal A-subgenome was revealed for both C. berlandieri and C. quinoa.},

Relationships in Atripliceae are poorly understood due to obscure and potentially convergent morphological characters. • METHODS Using sequence variation of two chloroplast markers (rbcL gene, atpB-rbcL spacer) and one nrDNA marker (ITS) analyzed with BEAST, we investigated the systematics and biogeography of Atripliceae. We surveyed flower morphology and fruit anatomy to study the evolution of flowers and fruits in the tribe. • KEY RESULTS Female flowers with persistent foliar cover (the diagnostic character of traditional Atripliceae) evolved three times in Chenopodioideae, in Atripliceae s.s., Axyrideae, and Spinacia. Atripliceae s.s. started to diversify during the Early Miocene in Eurasia, separating into the Archiatriplex and the Atriplex clades. The former consists of eight species-poor, disjunct, and morphologically heterogeneous genera and is likely a relictual lineage. The Atriplex clade comprises the majority of species and evolved one C(4) lineage 14.1-10.5 Ma, which diversified rapidly worldwide. The C(4) Atriplex entered North America during the Middle/Late Miocene and spread to South America subsequently. Australia was colonized by two C(4) lineages both arriving during the Late Miocene. One of them diversified rapidly, giving rise to most Australian Atriplex species. • CONCLUSIONS Atripliceae s.s. comprise Archiatriplex, Atriplex, Exomis, Extriplex, Grayia, Halimione, Holmbergia, Manochlamys, Proatriplex, and Stutzia. Microgynoecium is included based on morphology but only weak molecular support. Axyris, Krascheninnikovia, and Ceratocarpus (here described as Axyrideae) and Spinacia are excluded from Atripliceae.},

Here we use a molecular tree for the South American genus Alstroemeria to place karyological information, including fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) signals, in an explicit evolutionary context. METHODS From a phylogeny based on plastid, nuclear, and mitochondrial sequences for most species of Alstroemeria, we selected early-branching (Chilean) and derived (Brazilian) species for which we obtained 18S-25S and 5S rDNA FISH signals; we also analyzed chromosome numbers, 1C-values, and telomere FISH signals (in two species). KEY RESULTS Chromosome counts for Alstroemeria cf. rupestris and A. pulchella confirm 2n = 16 as typical of the genus, which now has chromosomes counted for 29 of its 78 species. The rDNA sites are polymorphic both among and within species, and interstitial telomeric sites in Alstroemeria cf. rupestris suggest chromosome fusion. CONCLUSIONS In spite of a constant chromosome number, closely related species of Alstroemeria differ drastically in their rDNA, indicating rapid increase, decrease, or translocations of these genes. Previously proposed Brazilian and Chilean karyotype groups are not natural, and the n = 8 chromosomes in Alstroemeria compared to n = 9 in its sister genus Bomarea may result from a Robertsonian fusion.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY Early plant taxonomists formed hypotheses about relationships among taxa based on characters such as morphology, anatomy, phytochemistry, ecology, and geography. Modern molecular systematic methods, based on DNA sequence variation, augment early methods and provide an additional line of evidence by which to evaluate taxonomic hypotheses. In North America north of Mexico, wild onions (Allium, Amaryllidaceae) are represented by 84 native species, 81 of which belong to subgenus Amerallium. On the basis of morphology, these species have been divided into eight informal taxonomic "alliances" hypothesized to represent shared evolutionary history among species. The main aim of this research was to test the monophyly of the alliances with molecular phylogenetic methods. METHODS We sampled 74 Amerallium species north of Mexico and two Mexican endemics and constructed a molecular phylogeny of subgenus Amerallium in North America based on predominantly noncoding sequences from two nuclear ribosomal RNA regions (ITS and ETS) and two plastid regions (trnL-F and rpL32-trnL). KEY RESULTS Most clades are well supported in analyses of nuclear data and when nuclear and plastid data are combined. However, the plastid data alone did not produce a well-resolved or well-supported tree. Morphological alliances were sometimes congruent with groups recovered in the molecular phylogeny, but strict monophyly was observed in only three of eight alliances. CONCLUSIONS We propose an infrageneric classification that recognizes two sections in New World Amerallium. Because there is substantial incongruence between morphological and molecular groups, we advocate retaining informal alliances rather than adopting formal subsections until further morphological and molecular analyses can be carried out.},

Phylogenies constructed with ITS alone or ITS in combination with ETS provided sufficient resolution for investigating evolutionary relationships among species. The ITS region alone was sufficient to resolve the deeper relationships in North American species. Addition of a second marker (ETS) further supports the phylogenetic placements of the North American species and adds resolution within subgenus Amerallium, a clade containing many Californian endemics. Within the global phylogeny, the native North American species were found to be monophyletic, with the exception of Allium tricoccum and Allium schoenoprasum. All native Californian species included in the analysis fell into a monophyletic subgenus Amerallium section Lophioprason, although endemic Californian species were not monophyletic due to the inclusion of species with ranges extending beyond the California Floristic Province. The molecular phylogeny strongly supports previous morphology-based taxonomic groupings. Based on our results, serpentine adaptation appears to have occurred multiple times within section Lophioprason, while the ancestor of the Californian center of diversity may not have been serpentine-adapted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS The genus Allium comprises more than 800 species, placing it among the largest monocotyledonous genera. It is a variable group that is spread widely across the Holarctic region. Previous studies of Allium have been useful in identifying and assessing its evolutionary lineages. However, there are still many gaps in our knowledge of infrageneric taxonomy and evolution of Allium. Further understanding of its phylogeny and biogeography will be achieved only through continued phylogenetic studies, especially of those species endemic to China that have often been excluded from previous analyses. Earlier molecular studies have shown that Chinese Allium is not monophyletic, so the goal of the present study was to infer the phylogeny and biogeography of Allium and to provide a classification of Chinese Allium by placement of Chinese species in the context of the entire phylogeny. METHODS Phylogenetic studies were based on sequence data of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplast rps16 intron, analysed using parsimony and Bayesian approaches. Biogeographical patterns were conducted using statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA). KEY RESULTS Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Allium is monophyletic and consists of three major clades. Optimal reconstructions have favoured the ancestors of Amerallium, Anguinum, Vvedenskya, Porphyroprason and Melanocrommyum as originating in eastern Asia. CONCLUSIONS Phylogenetic analyses reveal that Allium is monophyletic but that some subgenera are not. The large genetic distances imply that Allium is of ancient origin. Molecular data suggest that its evolution proceeded along three separate evolutionary lines. S-DIVA indicates that the ancestor of Amerallium, Anguinum, Vvedenskya, Porphyroprason and Melanocrommyum originated from eastern Asia and underwent different biogeographical pathways. A taxonomic synopsis of Chinese Allium at sectional level is given, which divides Chinese Allium into 13 subgenera and 34 sections.},

Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of two varieties of Allium cyathophorum and A. spicatum of subgenus Cyathophora, restricted to the HMR and the western QTP, respectively. Forty-five populations were surveyed for chloroplast and nuclear sequence variation to evaluate phylogenetic relationships, dates of divergence and ancestral area/inflorescence reconstructions. In addition, analyses were conducted on discernable micromorphologies, cytotypes and seed size variation. Our results indicated that two varieties of A. cyathophorum are separate species, i.e. A. farreri and A. cyathophorum, and the initial split of Cyathophora was triggered by the HMR uplift around 4-3 Ma. Subsequently, A. spicatum originated through the strengthened aridification in the western QTP induced vicariance of the ancestral populations in the HMR during the early Pleistocene. A self-sustaining allotetraploid species from A. farreri and A. cyathophorum was established during an interglacial period of penultimate glaciation of the QTP. Seed size variation also supports these by the colonization-competition tradeoff among small and large seeds. Our findings appear to suggest that the HMR uplift could have strengthened the development of the Asian monsoon regimes in this region and aridification in the western QTP, while the Quaternary climatic oscillations spurred the allopatric species' range shifts and created new open microhabitat for the alloploid species.},

Allium kingdonii was unequivocally placed within subgenus Amerallium and formed an immediate sister relationship with New World Amerallium clade, suggesting an unexpected intercontinental disjunct distribution. For another, Allium trifurcatum was firmly nested within subgenus Butomissa next to A. tuberosum and A. ramosum, but it is distinctly different morphologically from the latter by thinly leathery bulb tunics, uniovulate locule and obviously 3-cleft stigma. Based on the geographic features, morphological and molecular evidences, two new sections, Kingdonia X.J.He et D.Q.Huang for A. kingdonii and Trifurcatum X.J.He et D.Q.Huang for A. trifurcatum, were proposed. The remaining three species of subgenus Cyathophora formed a well-defined clade, and the phylogenetic relationships among them recovered were consistent with previous findings.

Here we conduct phylogenetic analysis with the nuclear marker ITS and three different chloroplast markers (rps16 intron, rbcL-atpB spacer, rpl32-trnL spacer). Divergence time estimations (Beast) relying on published ITS substitution rates and ancestral range reconstructions were calculated to elucidate the biogeographical history of the subgenus. Additionally we compiled distribution maps for all species with data taken from the literature, herbariums and data from field observations. The main radiation of the subgenus took place in the last one million years and is still going on. They have their origins in the mid Miocene in East Asia and were highly influenced by the climate fluctuations in the Pliocene/Pleistocene period. Conflicting tree topologies between nuclear and cpDNA markers of Allium tricoccum Solander indicate that the species is of hybridogenous origin. Cloning the ITS sequence revealed the parental copies and confirmed our conclusion. One originated from the Eurasian and the other from the East Asian clade. We were able to show that it reached North America most likely via the Beringia around 2.5mya (95\% HPD of 0.35-5.26mya). Our data suggest that Allium victorialis L. is only distributed in mountain pastures in Europe as it forms a well-supported clade in the ITS tree. In the analysis of the molecular markers we found two distinct types of Allium ochotense Prokh. and we suggest splitting the species based on Prokhanov's (1930) proposal.

The group is taxonomically complicated with different and contradictory taxonomic treatments, and was thought to include a considerable number of hybrid species, as the taxa show an admixture of assumed morphological key characters. We studied the phylogeny of the subgenus, covering all existing taxonomic groups and their entire geographic distribution. We analyzed sequences of the nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) for multiple individuals of more than 100 species. Phylogenetic analyses of cloned and directly sequenced PCR products confirmed the monophyly of the subgenus, while most sections were either para- or polyphyletic. The splits of the large sections are supported by differences in the anatomy of flower nectaries. ITS data (i) demand a new treatment at sectional level, (ii) do not support the hypotheses of frequent gene flow among species, (iii) indicate that multiple rapid radiations occurred within different monophyletic groups of the subgenus, and (iv) detected separately evolving lineages within three morphologically clearly defined species (cryptic species). In two cases these lineages were close relatives, while in Allium darwasicum they fall in quite different clades in the phylogenetic tree. Fingerprint markers show that this result is not due to ongoing introgression of rDNA (ITS capture) but that genome-wide differences between both lineages exist. Thus, we report one of the rare cases in plants where morphologically indistinguishable diploid species occurring in mixed populations are non-sister cryptic species.},

Six areas of endemism were used to describe the distribution: North America, South America, Eurasia, Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia. 18,000 trees retained from Bayesian inference of rbcL served as a framework to reconstruct the ancestral areas. The results suggested that the most recent common ancestor of Alismatidae most probably occurred in Eurasia, followed by a split into two major clades. The clade comprising Hydrocharitaceae, Butomaceae and Alismataceae mainly diversified in Eurasia and Africa. The other clade comprising the remaining families dispersed to southern hemisphere. Australia played an important role in diversification of this clade. Several families were suggested to have occurred in Australia, such as Ruppiaceae, Cymodoceaceae, Posidoniaceae and Zosteraceae.},

	abstract = {Alismataceae is an aquatic or semi-aquatic herb family with a subcosmopolitan distribution. The family is one of the oldest lineages within monocots and plays an important role in the systematics, biogeography and evolutionary processes of flowering plants. However, the generic relationships of the family are still a subject of debate, and its historical biogeography is less studied. In the present study, we carried out a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis based on multiple DNA sequences (nuclear: ITS; chloroplast: psbA, rbcL, matK, rpoB, rpoC1, trnK 5' intron and trnK 3' intron; mitochondria: cob and atp1). The result supports merging Limnocharitaceae into Alismataceae as one family. Two well-supported clades were obtained based on the combined ITS, psbA, rbcL and matK dataset. Clade B consists of Luronium, Damasonium, Baldellia and Alisma; and clade A consists of the remaining genera of Alismataceae as well as Limnocharitaceae. Biogeographic analysis and bayesian molecular dating suggested that Alismataceae originated in West Palearctic or Afrotropical area during the Late Cretaceous, and subsequently split into two clades. Clade A and clade B diversified in Afrotropical area and West Palearctic area, respectively. The intercontinental distribution of this family mainly resulted from dispersals involving migration across land bridges and long-distance dispersal.},

Therefore protection plans are crucially needed and call for thoroughly documenting the genetic diversity and clarifying the taxonomy of this endangered genus. Our sampling included 282 individuals from 42 natural populations and covered the whole geographical range of the genus, across Europe and the Mediterranean. We combined sequencing of nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplastic trnL-ndhF regions with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotyping to investigate the Alismataceae phylogeny, and produce a phylogeography of Baldellia. Our phylogeny strongly supported the monophyly of Baldellia and placed it as the sister clade to Luronium and Alisma, therefore excluding, as previously supposed, a close genetic relatedness to the predominantly neotropical genus Echinodorus. The phylogeography of Baldellia outlined patterns consistent with a hypothesis considering glacial refugia located in the Iberian Peninsula and the Italy/Balkan region from which two distinct genetic lineages re-colonized Europe. These two lineages corresponded respectively to Baldellia ranunculoides (Italy/Balkan derived populations) and Baldellia repens (populations recovered from the Iberian Peninsula refuge), therefore supporting differences outlined between the two taxa in previous ecological and morphological studies. These results allowed clarifying taxonomic uncertainties by confirming the genetic distinctness of B. repens according to B. ranunculoides. A third lineage, Baldellia alpestris, originated and remained endemic to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. Unexpectedly, B. repens populations collected in northern Africa, appeared to be genetically distinct from their European counterparts, this calls for further investigation to fully address their genetic and conservation status. Finally, we detected a large hybridization zone in northwestern Europe between B. repens and B. ranunculoides. These results were discussed in light of conservation approaches for Baldellia populations.},

A previous phylogenetic study of Aizoaceae subfamily Ruschioideae dated the radiation of this clade of {\textgreater} 1500 species in the GCFR to 3.8-8.7 Mya, establishing it as a flagship example of a diversification event triggered by the onset of a summer-arid climate in the region. However, a more recent analysis found an older age for the Ruschioideae lineage (17 Mya), suggesting that the group may in fact have originated much before the aridification of the region 10-15 Mya. Here, we reassess the tempo of radiation of ice plants by using the most complete generic-level phylogenetic tree for Aizoaceae to date, a revised calibration age and a new dating method. Our estimates of the age of the clade are even younger than initially thought (stem age 1.13-6.49 Mya), supporting the hypothesis that the radiation post-dates the establishment of an arid environment in the GCFR and firmly placing the radiation among the fastest in angiosperms (diversification rate of 4.4 species per million years). We also statistically examine environmental and morphological correlates of richness in ice plants and find that diversity is strongly linked with precipitation, temperature, topographic complexity and the evolution of highly succulent leaves and wide-band tracheids.},

	abstract = {The Aizoaceae is the largest family of leaf succulent plants, and most of its species are endemic to southern Africa. To evaluate subfamilial, generic, and tribal relationships, we produced two plastid DNA data sets for 91 species of Aizoaceae and four outgroups: rps16 intron and the trnL-F gene region (both the trnL intron and the trnL-F intergenic spacer). In addition, we generated two further plastid data sets for 56 taxa restricted to members of the Ruschioideae using the atpB-rbcL and the psbA-trnH intergenic spacers. In the combined tree of the rps16 intron and trnL-F gene region, three of the currently recognized subfamilies (Sesuvioideae, Mesembryanthemoideae, and Ruschioideae) are each strongly supported monophyletic groups. The subfamily Tetragonioideae is polyphyletic, with Tribulocarpus as sister to the Sesuvioideae and Tetragonia embedded in the Aizooideae. Our study showed that the group consisting of the Sesuvioideae, Aizooideae, and Tetragonioideae does not form a monophyletic entity. Therefore, it cannot be recognized as a separate family in order to accommodate the frequently used concept of the Mesembryanthemaceae or "Mesembryanthema," in which the subfamilies Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae are included. We also found that several genera within the Mesembryanthemoideae (Mesembryanthemum, Phyllobolus) are not monophyletic. Within the Ruschioideae, our study retrieved four major clades. However, even in the combined analysis of all four plastid gene regions, relationships within the largest of these four clades remain unresolved. The few nucleotide substitutions that exist among taxa of this clade point to a rapid and recent diversification within the arid winter rainfall area of southern Africa. We propose a revised classification for the Aizoaceae.},

	abstract = {The Aizooideae is an early-diverging lineage within the Aizoaceae. It is most diverse in southern Africa, but also has endemic species in Australasia, Eurasia and South America. We derived a phylogenetic hypothesis from Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses of plastid DNA-sequences. We find that one of the seven genera, the fynbos-endemic Acrosanthes, does not belong to the Aizooideae, but is an ancient sister-lineage to the subfamilies Mesembryanthemoideae \& Ruschioideae. Galenia and Plinthus are embedded inside Aizoon and Aizoanthemum is polyphyletic. The Namibian endemic Tetragonia schenckii is sister to Tribulocarpus of the Sesuvioideae. For the Aizooideae, we explored their possible age by means of relaxed Bayesian dating and used Bayesian Binary MCMC reconstruction of ancestral areas to investigate their area of origin. Early diversification occurred in southern Africa in the Eocene-Oligocene, with a split into a mainly African lineage and an Eurasian-Australasian-African-South American lineage. These subsequently radiated in the early Miocene. For Tetragonia, colonisation of Australasia via long-distance dispersal from Eurasia gave rise to the Australasian lineage from which there were subsequent dispersals to South America and Southern Africa. Despite the relatively old age of the Aizooideae, more than half the species have radiated since the Pleiocene, coinciding with the large and rapid diversification of the Ruschioideae. The lineage made up of Tetragonia schenckii \&Tribulocarpus split from the remainder of the Sesuvioideae already in the mid Oligocene and its disjunct distribution between Namibia and north-east Africa may be the result of a previously wider distribution within an early Arid African flora. Our reconstruction of ancestral character-states indicates that the expanding keels giving rise to hygrochastic fruits originated only once, i.e. after the split of the Sesuvioideae from the remainder of the Aizoaceae and that they were subsequently lost many times. Variously winged and spiky fruits, adapted to dispersal by wind and animals, have evolved independently in the Aizooideae and the Sesuvioideae. There is then a greater diversity of dispersal systems in the earlier lineages than in the Mesembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae, where dispersal is mainly achieved by rain.},

	abstract = {The Ruschieae is a large tribe of about 1600 species of succulent perennials. They form a major component of the arid parts of the Greater Cape Floristic Region, both in numbers of species and in their density of coverage. So far phylogenetic relationships within the tribe have been unresolved, largely through the paucity of variable molecular characters and this is ascribed to the tribe's recent and rapid radiation. Our phylogeny is based on 10 chloroplast gene regions and represents a nearly complete sampling of the 100 currently recognised genera of the Ruschieae. These chloroplast regions yielded relatively few phylogenetically informative characters, consequently providing only limited resolution in and poor support for many parts of the phylogeny. Nevertheless, for the first time, we provide well-supported evidence that taxa with mostly mesomorphic, often ephemeral leaves and weakly persistent fruits form a basal grade of lineages in the Ruschieae. These lineages subtend a large polytomy of taxa with almost exclusively xeromorphic, persistent leaves and strongly persisting fruits. Among the basal grade of lineages, those occurring within the winter-rainfall region typically shed their leaves or form (at least partly) a protective, dry sheath around the apical bud during the dry summer months, as a means of escaping the summer drought. This contrasts with taxa of the basal grade from outside the winter-rainfall region, in which the leaves persist. Our results show that, in both strongly and weakly persistent fruits, specialised characteristics of the fruit evolved repeatedly and so these structures are highly homoplasious. Perhaps as a consequence of repeated changes towards increased persistence and specialisation of leaves and fruits, several clades show little morphological cohesion. However, as in other groups in the Cape Flora, most clades in the Ruschieae represent regional groupings. Our analysis of sequences of the nuclear gene 'chloroplast-expressed glutamine synthetase' (ncpGS) revealed extensive paralogy within the Ruschieae, but found an intact reading frame in all its members. More data on the cytology of the Ruschieae is needed to evaluate whether the paralogy observed is due to gene duplication or polyploidy.},

Rapid and recent radiations in Southern African plant genera were triggered by fine-scale differences in climate, topography and geology. The genus Lithops (Ruschioideae, Aizoaceae) contains 37 species and is widely distributed in Southern Africa. Species delimitation within the genus is challenging because the limited number of morphological characters in these reduced succulents varies intensely between populations, presumably as adaptations to local geological environments. We analysed phylogenetic relationships within Lithops using non-coding chloroplast DNA (trnS-trnG intergenic spacer), nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) sequences and AFLP data. Genetic variability of the sequence data was very low, but AFLP data detected nine clades within Lithops that do not fit current morphology-based taxonomy. Two of these clades are separated by their distribution on the northern and eastern border of the distribution area, and four clades are found in the Gariep Centre in the estuary of the Orange River. Morphological similarities, especially colour of leaves, evolved repeatedly within the clades, thus we hypothesise that closely related species became adapted to different soil types in a mosaic-like geological environment. One-third of the species are found in the Gariep Centre, characterised by extremely diverse edaphic habitats.},

Analysis of diversification in this interaction has been hampered by the lack of a robust phylogeny for the genus. Here we attempt the first extensive nuclear DNA based assessment of the phylogenetic relationships of Yucca. We used AFLP markers to recover the phylogeny of 87 samples representing 38 Yucca taxa. An analysis based on 4322 markers strongly supported a topology consistent with morphological classification at the section level (capsular-fruited Chaenocarpa, fleshy-fruited Sarcocarpa, and spongy-fruited Clistocarpa). Within Sarcocarpa, all but two of the traditional species were monophyletic. Within Chaenocarpa, the morphologically distinct series Rupicolae was strongly supported. In the remaining Chaenocarpa, a western group (Colorado Plateau southward) and an eastern group (Great Plains, central Texas east to Florida) were recovered. Within these groups, where taxonomic circumscriptions are narrow and historically contested, there was at most limited monophyly of traditional taxa, suggesting rapid recent diversification, introgression, or non-monophyletically circumscribed taxa.},

	abstract = {Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a modified form of photosynthesis that has arisen independently at least 35 times in flowering plants. The occurrence of CAM is often correlated with shifts to arid, semiarid, or epiphytic habits, as well as transitions in leaf morphology (e.g. increased leaf thickness) and anatomy (e.g. increased cell size and packing). We assess shifts between C3 and CAM photosynthesis in the subfamily Agavoideae (Asparagaceae) through phylogenetic analysis of targeted loci captured from the nuclear and chloroplast genomes of over 60 species. Carbon isotope data was used as a proxy for mode of photosynthesis in extant species and ancestral states were estimated on the phylogeny. Ancestral character state mapping suggests three independent origins of CAM in the Agavoideae. CAM species differ from C3 species in climate space and are found to have thicker leaves with densely packed cells. C3 ancestors of CAM species show a predisposition toward CAM-like morphology. Leaf characteristics in the ancestral C3 species may have enabled the repeated evolution of CAM in the Agavoideae subfamily. Anatomical changes, including a tendency toward 3D venation, may have initially arisen in C3 ancestors in response to aridity as a way to increase leaf succulence for water storage.},

Our analyses indicate that Agave is a young genus, between 7.8 and 10.1 million years old, and yet it harbors the most species of any genera in the family. Of the eight genera in the family, Agave is paraphyletic with respect to three of them, and these four genera are often grouped into a genus termed Agave sensu lato, which harbors 208 of the 293 recognized species in the Agavaceae. In this article, we examine the phylogenetic limits of Agave sensu lato and present analyses elucidating the origin and rate of speciation in the group. These analyses lead to some new insights into the phylogenetic limits of Agave, indicate an estimated age of the family between 20 and 26 million years and an age of the Agave sensu lato of {\textless}/=10 million years. Furthermore, we estimate a high mean per-lineage rate of diversification for the genus and find that rates of speciation were significantly elevated between 8 and 6 million years ago and then again between 3 and 2.5 million years ago. We discuss the potential for both monocarpy and the evolution of a generalist pollination system, largely dependent on nectarivorous bat species, as possible driving factors in the radiation of the group.},

(comprising Camassia, Chlorogalum, Hastingsia, and Schoenolirion) and relatives in Agavaceae. We present the first phylogenetic hypotheses focused on Chlorogaloideae that are based on multiple independent loci and include a wide sampling of outgroups across Agavaceae. In addition to chloroplast regions ndhF and trnL-trnF, we used nrDNA ITS for phylogenetic inference. Incomplete concerted evolution of the latter is indicated by intra-individual site polymorphisms for nearly half of the individuals. Comparisons of four coding and analysis methods for these characters indicate that the region remains phylogenetically informative. Our results confirm that Chlorogaloideae s.s. is not monophyletic, due to the close relationship of Schoenolirion with Hesperaloe and Hesperoyucca, as well as the likely sister relationship between Hesperocallis and core Chlorogaloideae (Camassia, Chlorogalum, and Hastingsia). Chlorogalum is also not monophyletic, being divided with strong support into vespertine and diurnal clades. This study produced the first phylogenetic hypotheses across Hesperaloe, allowing initial tests of several taxonomic disagreements within this genus. Our results reveal the lack of cohesion of H. funifera, indicating that H. funifera ssp. funifera may be more closely related to H. campanulata than to H. funifera ssp. chiangii (=H. chiangii). With potential gene flow between many members of Hesperaloe and a possible hybrid origin for H. campanulata, the genetic relationships within this genus appear complex. Further population-level investigation of many of the taxa in Chlorogaloideae s.l. would benefit our understanding of the evolution and taxonomy of these groups; Camassia and Hastingsia are the current focus of ongoing study.},

We took a three-step approach to examine if plant and pollinator speciation events were likely driven by coevolution. First, we tested whether there has been co-speciation between yuccas and pollinator yucca moths in the genus Tegeticula (Prodoxidae). Second, we tested whether co-speciation also occurred between yuccas and commensalistic yucca moths in the genus Prodoxus (Prodoxidae) in which reciprocal evolutionary change is unlikely. Finally, we examined the current range distributions of yuccas in relationship to pollinator speciation events to determine if plant and moth speciation events likely occurred in sympatry or allopatry. Co-speciation analyses of yuccas with their coexisting Tegeticula pollinator and commensalistic Prodoxus lineages demonstrated phylogenetic congruence between both groups of moths and yuccas, even though moth lineages differ in the type of interaction with yuccas. Furthermore, Yucca species within a lineage occur primarily in allopatry rather than sympatry. We conclude that biogeographic factors are the overriding force in plant and pollinator moth speciation and significant phylogenetic congruence between the moth and plant lineages is likely due to shared biogeography rather than coevolution.},

METHODS Synonymous divergences (K(s)) were calculated for all duplications within gene families and examined for evidence of large-scale duplication events. Phylogenetic comparisons for a selection of orthologues among several related species in Ericales and two outgroups permitted placement of duplication events in relation to lineage divergences. Gene ontology (GO) categories were analysed for each whole-genome duplication (WGD) and the whole transcriptome. KEY RESULTS Evidence for three ancient WGDs in Actinidia was found. Analyses of paleologue GO categories indicated a different pattern of retained genes for each genome duplication, but a pattern consistent with the dosage-balance hypothesis among all retained paleologues. CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence for one independent WGD in the ancestry of Actinidia (Ad-alpha), a WGD shared by Actinidia and Camellia (Ad-beta), and the well-established At-gamma WGD that occurred prior to the divergence of all taxa examined. More ESTs in other taxa are needed to elucidate which groups in Ericales share the Ad-beta or Ad-alpha duplications and their impact on diversification.},

The analysis of cp sequence data confirms the hypothesis that the four currently recognized sections are not monophyletic. The detection of incongruences among phylogenies (mtDNA vs. cpDNA tree) coupled with the detection of intraspecific polymorphisms confirms some of the reticulations previously emphasized, diagnoses new hybridization/introgression events, and provides evidence for multiple origin of at least two polyploid taxa. A number of hybridization/introgression events at the diploid, tetraploid, and possibly hexaploid levels are documented. The extensive reticulate evolution undergone by Actinidia could account for the lack of clear morphological discontinuities at the species level.},

These features, together with molecular data, were used to test the phylogenetic placement of Satanocrater within the large plant family Acanthaceae. METHODS We undertook a comparative study of four species of Satanocrater. Carbon isotope ratios were generated to test a hypothesis of C(4) photosynthesis. Molecular data from chloroplast (trnG-trnS, trnG-trnR, psbA-trnH) and nuclear (Eif3E) loci were used to test the placement of Satanocrater within Acanthaceae. KEY RESULTS Anatomical features reflecting xeric adaptations of species of Satanocrater included a thick-walled epidermis, thick cuticle, abundant trichomes and glandular scales, stomata overarched by subsidiary cells, tightly packed mesophyll cells, and well-developed palisade parenchyma on both leaf surfaces. Although two species had enlarged bundle sheath cells, a feature often implicated in C(4) photosynthesis, isotope ratios indicated all species of Satanocrater use the C(3) pathway. Molecular data resolved Satanocrater within tribe Ruellieae with strong support. Within Ruellieae, our data suggest that pollen morphology of Satanocrater may represent an intermediate stage in a transition series. CONCLUSIONS Anatomical and morphological features of Satanocrater reflect adaptation to xeric environments and add new information about the biology of xerophytes. Morphological and molecular data place Satanocrater in the tribe Ruellieae with confidence. This study adds to our capacity to test hypotheses of broad evolutionary and ecological interest in a diverse and important family of flowering plants.},

While parsimony analysis of ITS recovers a nonmonophyletic subtribe, maximum likelihood analysis of ITS corroborates results from trnL-F and suggests that systematic error is impacting on ITS parsimony analysis. A combined ITS and trnL-F analysis strengthens the signal and also recovers a monophyletic subtribe. All analyses indicate that Hemigraphis, Sericocalyx, and Strobilanthes are nonmonophyletic. With one exception, all morphological characters included in a combined ITS and morphological analysis are homoplastic. The prospect for a new informative generic classification of the Strobilanthinae aiming to recognize and diagnose only monophyletic groups is considered. While some groups can be diagnosed, adequate diagnosis of the majority of groups remains problematic.

	abstract = {Acanthaceae (Asteridae; Lamiales) include ∼4000 species and encompass a range of morphological diversity, habitats, and biogeographic patterns. Although they are important components of tropical and subtropical habitats worldwide, inadequate knowledge of the family's phylogenetic framework has impeded comparative research. In this study, we sampled all known lineages of Acanthaceae including Andrographideae. Also included were eight of 13 genera whose relationships remain enigmatic. We used sequence data from nrITS and four chloroplast noncoding regions, and parsimony and Bayesian methods of analysis. Results strongly support most aspects of relationships including inclusion of Avicennia in Acanthaceae. Excepting Neuracanthus, newly sampled taxa are placed with strong support; Kudoacanthus is in Justicieae, Tetramerium lineage, and the remaining enigmatic genera are in Whitfieldieae or Barlerieae, and Andrographideae are sister to Barlerieae. This last result is unanticipated, but placement of Andrographideae based on structural characters has been elusive. Neuracanthus is monophyletic but placement relative to (Whitfieldieae (Andrographideae + Barlerieae)) is weakly supported. Many clades have clear morphological synapomorphies, but nonmolecular evidence for some remains elusive. Results suggest an Old World origin with multiple dispersal events to the New World. This study informs future work by clarifying sampling strategy and identifying aspects of relationships that require further study.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY The Tetramerium lineage (Acanthaceae) presents a striking ecological structuring in South America, with groups concentrated in moist forests or in seasonally dry forests. In this study, we investigate the circumscription and relationships of the South American genera as a basis for better understanding historic interactions between dry and moist biomes in the Neotropics. METHODS We dated the ancestral distribution of the Tetramerium lineage based on one nuclear and four plastid DNA regions. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses were performed for this study using 104 terminals. Phylogenetic divergences were dated using a relaxed molecular clock approach and ancestral distributions obtained from dispersal-vicariance analyses. KEY RESULTS The genera Pachystachys, Schaueria, and Thyrsacanthus are nonmonophyletic. A dry forest lineage dispersed from North America to South America and reached the southwestern part of the continent between the end of the Miocene and beginning of the Pleistocene. This period coincides with the segregation between Amazonian and Atlantic moist forests that established the geographic structure currently found in the group. CONCLUSIONS The South American genera Pachystachys, Schaueria, and Thyrsacanthus need to be recircumscribed. The congruence among biogeographical events found for the Tetramerium lineage suggests that the dry forest centers currently dispersed throughout South America are relatively old remnants, probably isolated since the Neogene, much earlier than the Last Glacial Maximum postulated by the Pleistocene Arc hypothesis. In addition to exploring the Pleistocene Arc hypothesis, this research also informs evolution in a lineage with numerous geographically restricted and threatened species.},
